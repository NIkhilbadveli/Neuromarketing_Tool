Picture 2 -  highdebra has been one of our hybrid clients and previously has started “The 60-Day Sculpt Challenge” where she’s smashed all the workouts  ticked off her daily habits that I set and been almost as perfect as you could do be with nutrition. Not too strict  just small changes over time. 

Picture 3 -  kstew05 progress has been outstanding as the pictures don’t show her Squat and Deadlifts that have also been going through the roof  Katrina has been doing the female fat loss programme in her own commercial gym. The goal was bring up the back and booty while getting leaner. We’ve done just that

278,adamcollard,influencers,"Pedal to the metal  Summer Shredding is almost upon us and you don’t want to leave it to late this year to get in shape… I’m thinking another sculpt challenge is on the horizon  and bigger and better than ever 

I’m pumped to start ramping things up  posting more about getting lean and let’s face it whatever you’re training for we all want to look good right  and that’s okay too  too many people talk sh t about that these days but it’s probably why most of us started to train in the first place. To look a little better and feel a little bit better about ourselves. 

If you want to get involved keep your eyes peeled or drop me a DM “coaching” to find out a little more info early  LFG 

 SummerShredding  sculpt  "
279,adamcollard,influencers,"Want to get a better Front Squat  Trust me  I’m by no means a good Squatter  it’s a battle every session. But here’s some basics that will help you out to move better and help you feel more confident in the gym that we use with  sculpt   members 

1. Improve your ankle mobility
This is the reason you see so many people use 5kg plates under there feet in the gym. Or wear lifters. You are  lifehacking yourself some better ankle mobility. 
I’d recommend finding a good routine on YouTube  squatuniversity is the man with this  and keep doing it before you squat. Normally some Deep Knee Over Toe Lunges do the trick.

2. Keep your elbows and eyes up
We all have a tendency to want to look down but really that’s a one way ticket to the bar falling forwards. Try to stay as upright as possible  and keep the elbows up  you’ll see I start losing it as this is close to my max  and you’ll just be focussing on driving the bar up rather than fighting to keep it close to you at the same time. 

3. Breathing is important 
Learning how to effectively breathe during a squat or any lift is important. If you can’t inhale  create abdominal pressure  and keep it until you’ve finished a Rep. You’ll probably fail whatever it is you’re doing. 
Think about taking a breath in at the top  holding it there for the full descent/and drive up before exhaling again. 

4. Tempo Reps 
I think slow negatives  the downward  phase of a Rep on literally any exercise in the gym has helped me understand if something doesn’t feel right and my form is off. Squat with 3-4 seconds on the way down during your warm up sets  or just work like this with light-moderate weights for a few weeks and you’ll understand what’s going wrong in your squat. 
We incorporate tempos a lot at sculpt  the clients that listen to it  always improve the most… 

5. Pause Reps 
Similar to tempo above  if you can control and gain confidence in the bottom position you’ll be more comfortable there with load/weight. Not to mention it forces you to be more explosive and builds strength out of the bottom of the Rep.

281,adamcollard,influencers,"It doesn’t always have to be “go hard or go home” 

Life gains matter too

Yes train as hard as you can when you’re in the four walls of the gym  or whatever your chosen fitness is… 

But don’t think that you can’t get a little bit fitter or leaner if you’re not willing to give up 2-3 hours a day  7 days a week and eat like a monk. 

Of course you can. 

Whether it’s 3 days a week  or 6 days a week if you can give an hour a day on those days you can still make progress. 

Smart  gradual changes  for long consistent periods of time are the winner and guess what.. 

You can still have a life. 

If you’re trying to be the top 5  in any sport  no you’re not going to have any balance. But for the most of us  you’re just killing yourself for no reason.

Yes you can be flexible in your fitness approach but somewhere along the line you’re going to have to make a few small sacrifices. 

The question I always get is..

“Yeah but I saw you drinking last weekend” 

“Yeah but I saw you eat dessert the other night” 

The fact of the matter is  I’ve “done the time”   made sacrifices certain times of the year  each year  for the last 7 years. Which allows me to look good  feel good  and be more flexible. 

If I mess up a few days  I can pull it back by doing some extra conditioning  steps or some smart nutrition. 

But to get there is the hard part  to get to that body fat   or flat stomach  or six pack is what’s tough. 

Your weekends are undoing all of your progress and that’s probably why you feel better  feel stronger but maybe aren’t seeing visible results.

Think about it again  you are ONLY 4-6 weeks of being a little bit more intense  being boring on weekends  passing a few socials   then you could reach your goals  look and feel amazing and keep it for good.

Focus - More Glutes than the conventional variation 

1⃣ Hands inside leg. Not in line with legs or you’ll “zig zag” the bar path 

2⃣ Shoulder blades in back pockets of your “jeans” 

3⃣ Take the slack out of the barbell. DO NOT JERK the bar up with flexed arms. Get tight before you lift. 

4⃣ Hip Hinge  don’t turn it into a squat. Think about being a half open book with your body  and aiming to “open the book” 

5⃣ Breathing - don’t breathe during your pull. Breathe at the bottom on your reset or you’ll lose intra-abdominal pressure. 

6⃣ Wear the right footwear    Stop lifting in runners if you’re doing any lift. Squat  deadlift  lunge

Things to think about 
• Chin to bar 

• Fully Legthen arms at bottom of each Rep  ours could do with work in this video  

• Maintain that hollow body position  to engage abs rather than doing that cross-legged thing you see people do in the gym 

If pull ups is something you want to do in the future  replicate the pull up rather than using a machine that will put you in a compromised position.

1⃣ Barbell Hip Thrusts 
Treat this as more of a compound exercise   opt to stick between 5-12 Reps. This is a movement that you will be able to go heavier on even as a beginner. 

2⃣ DB “High” Box Step Up
As soon as you increase the height of the box you’re going to get more glute activation. Credit to my man  bretcontreras1 for backing this up. 
I prefer hitting 8-12 Reps per leg on this one  slightly higher. 

3⃣ The  Bulgarian Split Squats 

Possibly the best exercise you’ll ever do. I’m a huge fan  all round lowebody development  fixes imbalances and you don’t have to worry as much as a squat for lower back pain. Try this

Squatting is a weakness of mine  on the back rack anyway. So besides my 2 staple lower bias days  I’ve added on just 2-3 top sets of Back Squats on a Saturday before predominantly a full upper session. The extra frequency should help combat a week link and doesn’t really fatigue my upper body. 

Bodybuilding to the clock - for most of the everyday gym goers  we rest to long  and don’t put enough stress/stimulus on our body to adapt. Adding a time domain can ramp up that intensity you’re missing.

362,adamcollard,influencers,"Swipe for what I eat to stay in shape  a lot of people have been DM’ing me for nutritional advice over the last week and to be honest I always have to be super careful with this for a few reasons.. 

 1 - Everybody’s output is different on a daily/weekly basis  steps you do  your job  training sessions per week  intensity and more…

 2 - Everybody has different goals - some people are killing themselves to get abs  some want to gain weight  and some people believe it or not just want to feel better in day to day life   during sessions 

Here are a few steps I would definitely take to dial in your nutrition whoever you are  and whatever your goal is…

To do list 

- 2g’s of Protein per KG of Bodyweight
 
- Drink a gallon of water a day 

- Eat more nutrient dense foods like fruits and veggies 

- Cook more home-cooked meals 

- Start reading food labels rather than just the “low fat” “low carb” stickers. You’ll be shocked. 

And the big one…

- Start monitoring your intake more. Whether you do strict tracking or have a subconscious idea of what you’re putting in. You’ll be surprised and start making better decisions. Try a 48 hour food diary on your notes pages.

- You have to expend  burn  more calories than you’re consuming for a period of time to get leaner.  I do this for 12 weeks pre summer ever year 

- If you are in a 500 cal deficit Monday to Friday  but go 1500 calories over your allowance on weekends. 
Do the maths  your weekly average  you are not really in a deficit. 

- I did this workout and more  for about 4 years and never saw any abs until I understood calorie control and energy balance. My diet was sh t and I thought I could outwork it  I couldn’t. 

- If the truths known  these exercises are great. But still not as good as deadlifting heavy  squatting heavy and that probably built my abs just as much if not more. 

Key points to focus on 

1. Consume Less Calories by 500 per day 

2. Move more  steps up  training up 

3. Eat More High Volume/Low Calorie Foods  try eating a 100 calories of broccoli vs a snickers. 1 takes 10 minutes and you’re full for hours  the other takes 2 seconds. 

4. Increase Protein - eat more Meat  fish  eggs and the vegan proteins too. Protein keeps you full for longer  which means less snacking and helps you repair and grow. 

5. Rinse and repeat those until desired effect.

Now I never just train one body part during a session. I usually do a full upper body day but here are my favourite shoulder movements at the moment. 

DB 1 1/4 Shoulder Press - adding in the extra 1/4 Portion of the press at the bottom of the movement really creates a lot of tension on the delts. 

Upright BB Rows - doesn’t have to be heavy  nice and controlled thinking about driving the elbows up to the ears. Shoulders and forearms on 

DB Lateral Raises - Great for building your delts and fixing imbalances from left to right. 

Face Pulls - Focusing on the rear delts is important as most of us are so dominant on the front delt from years of forgetting about pulling movements in early training years. This will actually help your posture and all round shoulder health too. 

Try some of these out and mix them into your training. We do on various of the sculpt online programmes.

If you aren’t motivated for the gym right now.. Don’t worry about it  you aren’t the only one. 

Today  I couldn’t be bothered at all. 
It happens to all of us at times. 

Here are a few things I do that help get me going at the moment 

• If it’s light outside still  not much right now  walk for 10-15 minutes pre gym. Gets us moving lightly and something about sunlight is gold. 

• Write down your session before you walk in the gym so you have a plan. Less time wasted  in   out.  HaveAPlan

•Do something easy to get you moving and ramp your body temperature up. I bet you’ll get more out of your session. 
Example  
2 Rounds of  
30s Easy Row / 30s Hard Row 
12 Air Squats 
10 Ball Slams 
8 Burpees 

•I think of training and the gym a bit like work.. if I don’t go to work  I’m not going to get paid. 
The same thought process comes with the gym  if I don’t train at least 4 hours per week  I know I’m going to feel terrible mentally  physically get lazy  and to be honest not maintain the way I want to look to feel confident. 

That’s all my tips for motivation  I hope they helped. Im very excited for an outrageous January of helping as many of you as possible get into the best shape of your lives. 

Keep your eyes peeled on what we’ve got coming or grab an E-Book and get a head-start on the year.

402,aliceliveing,influencers,"I saw a video on TikTok the other day with over 1 million likes  and the subject was a girl claiming that just 7 core exercises had given her defined abs. ⁣
⁣
And it’s an easy sell right  Do these and expect this result. But sadly  it just doesn’t work like that. ⁣
⁣
As explained in the video  abs are visible when your body fat is low enough for them to be seen. We all have them. It’s just for many of us we sit at a weight that doesn’t make them visible most of the time. ⁣
⁣
Achieving abs used to be a huge fitspo goal  but I hope that we’ve moved beyond that one track mind of training for aesthetics. ⁣
⁣
Instead try and focus your goals towards developing a strong core with various exercises that help you in all other movements within your training. Rotational work  anti rotational work  anti extension  anti lateral flexion etc. And don’t forget that the pelvic floor makes up part of your core too  ⁣
⁣
So instead of doing endless core workouts in the hope of getting abs  work towards building a super strong core instead that will have far more function than visible abdominal muscles which doesn’t always equate to a functionally strong core. ⁣

 Abs  Core  FitnessAdvice"
403,aliceliveing,influencers,"A mistake I tend to see people make is doing endless crunches to achieve abs. ⁣
⁣
First things first  abs aren’t made through endless ab exercises. Our abdominal muscles simply appear more the lower our body fat across our abdomen  so reducing body fat   abs. Not doing 100 sit ups before bed. ⁣
⁣
That aside  it’s important to strengthen our core regardless of whether you’re wanting to lose body fat or not. Our core plays a crucial role in almost all movements and training it should form a part of your overall training.⁣
⁣
This is one of my favourite core exercises. An advancement on a typical dead bug  this core exercise works anti extension focusing on training the core to resistent the extension through the spine. ⁣
⁣
Top tips  ⁣
⁣
  If you’ve never done this exercise before  start with a dead bug and work your way up. ⁣

  Extend opposite legs away whilst extending the arms away from the body. ⁣

  Focus on pulling the belly button down to the floor and pressing the lower back in to the floor. 

  Exhale as you extend away  inhale as you draw back in. ⁣

405,aliceliveing,influencers,"Cardiovascular exercise is important. I am not denying that. ⁣
⁣
But those who feel they HAVE to run might want to carry on watching. ⁣
⁣
Firstly  when it comes to cardio  the question is always WHAT do YOU want to get from it  ⁣
⁣
Do you want to run for longer  Do you want to train for an event  Do you want to improve your CRF  ⁣
⁣
As with most things in the fitness world  the reality is that your relationship with cardio really comes down to context and what you specifically want to get from it. ⁣
⁣
So sure  if you want to run a marathon  you’re going to need to run. ⁣
⁣
But if like me  you really don’t like running and you still want to improve your CRF  cardiovascular respiratory fitness  there are SO many other options for you to try. ⁣
⁣
My training right now include 1-2 days of quick uphill walking on a treadmill. Sure  boring to some. To me  I listen to a podcast and zone out. In addition to this I add on some intervals to the end of some of my sessions like the above. 5 rounds of 150m on the ski erg. Done. ⁣
⁣
The thing I’m really trying to get home here is that you HAVE to make exercise work for YOU. It’s got to tick the boxes of making you feel good  and be something you’re able to stick to long term. ⁣
⁣
So if running isn’t your thing  and you’re nearing summer thinking you HAVE to do cardio to lose body fat or change body composition  please remember that ANY exercise can do that. And choosing one you enjoy is far more important than hating the process. ⁣

It’s just that you’re not meant to be everyone’s best friend. None of us are. And being different and liking different people is what makes the world go round. ⁣

Today I chose to listen to my body and opt for something more restorative that isn’t going to put my body under too much stress. When we are in the late luteal phase of our cycle  our body can actually be more suited to endurance based exercise and so something like a gentle run  walk  swim or cycle could be a good option. 

I walked for 45 minutes on a treadmill  got my heart rate up  and feel so much better for it.

415,aliceliveing,influencers,"One of my biggest learnings over the past few years is that fitness isn’t my whole identity. ⁣
⁣
Sure  it’s something I LOVE. And something that is a big part of my life. ⁣
⁣
But it doesn’t define me in the way I previously thought. ⁣
⁣
I used to be the girl with the abs. And when those went  I worried that I had lost my space in the fitness world. That I somehow wasn’t seen as valued as when I had the body that matched people’s perception of what fitness is. ⁣
⁣
Now I really enjoy that my identity is so much more than just my body. I love so much more than just being in the gym. And I don’t expect to be judged by my body  although undoubtedly that still happens   but would rather be judged by my brain and whether I’m a good coach  whether I’m a good person and am I in some way relatable or not. ⁣
⁣
I guess what I’m trying to say is that for a lot of people  fitness really became their whole life. It did for me. But there is so much more to life than just being placed in one box. Yes you can still love your workouts and it can make up a big part of who you are. But there is also so much more to you than just burpees and box jumps. ⁣

417,aliceliveing,influencers,"Let’s talk about exercise addiction. ⁣
⁣
It’s a complex subject and one that I feel needs more talking about in the fitness industry. ⁣
⁣
When I first started training I LOVED it. I loved that I’d found something that made me feel good. That I’d found something that I actually enjoyed when it came to exercising. And so  like a lot of things that we enjoy  I wanted more of it. ⁣
⁣
And more of it meant  I did A LOT of it. Subconsciously because it was making me look better  consciously because it was validated by others that my ‘dedication’ and ‘commitment’ was seen as inspiring. ⁣
⁣
But what happens when your love for something goes a little too far… ⁣
⁣
‘Exercise addiction is a state characterized by a compulsive engagement in any form of physical exercise  despite negative consequences. Exercise addiction generally involves performing excessive amounts of exercise to the detriment of physical health  spending too much time exercising to the detriment of personal and professional life  and exercising regardless of physical injury’ ⁣
⁣
The added issue is that a lot of people rely on exercise as a sort of therapy  which in some ways is great but in others means that it can be overused. ⁣
⁣
The physical and mental ramifications of over training and under recovering are huge. But unfortunately we don’t see the same attention to this issue as we do to the usual diet culture issues or other addictions. 
⁣
So I want to talk about my own experience openly in the hope that it resonates with some of you. ⁣
⁣
Doing too much training will affect your physical well-being. I experienced the exact issues that I now warn people of. And I don’t want the same to happen to you. ⁣
⁣
So what can you do  ⁣
⁣
First things first  if you’re worried you’re struggling with exercise addiction  please speak to a professional. ⁣
⁣
Taking adequate rest in relation to your training load is crucial. ⁣
⁣
Eating enough to sustain your training and energy expenditure is crucial. ⁣
⁣
And finding more tools in your toolbox to help your mental well-being beyond training. ⁣

420,aliceliveing,influencers,"5 reasons not to skip your warm up  ⁣
⁣
1. A good warm up should start to raise your core temperature and get your muscles readied for your workout. ⁣

2. A good warm up may help to improve flexibility and mobility. A reminder that these two things are different  but working on some specific mobility to increase strength at end ranges  and mobility to improve range of movement may be bettered in a good warm up. ⁣

3. A good warm up may improve workout performance. If your body is readied for your workout  the chances are you’re going to be able to perform better and get more from your big lifts.
 ⁣
4. A good warm up may help to prevent injury. I say may because injuries can happen at any time  sometimes regardless of a good and thorough warm up  but stepping straight from the street in to your workout isn’t ideal for reducing your chances of injury. ⁣

5. A good warm up will mentally prepare you for your workout. Getting your mind focused on the session ahead is important  and your warm up is the perfect time to do this. ⁣

427,aliceliveing,influencers,"I want to be honest here. Today I felt incredibly uncomfortable in my body. ⁣
⁣
I’ve been away and I’ve enjoyed all the food and all the moments of happiness. But there is no denying that my gym kit felt tight this morning. And I can feel that my body has gained a little weight and that’s never an easy process to accept. ⁣
⁣
If I’m truly honest  it’s what stopped me going to the gym yesterday. I just couldn’t face being in that space and feeling as I did. ⁣
⁣
Having come so far from a place of dieting  it feels almost shameful to say that I actually want to lean up a bit. I’ve done the work to improve so much of how I feel about my body  but I also LOVE my fitness and right now I feel slow and heavy. ⁣
⁣
You know that I always lead with 100  transparency on here. I won’t lie or hide how I’m feeling because that serves no purpose. Instead I just wanted to share my current thoughts because I know that so many who’ve gone through the transition I have can also feel how I feel now. ⁣
⁣
It isn’t wrong to want to change your body. I fundamentally believe that. But the motivation has to be from a healthy and positive place. Do I want to end up where I was 5 years ago  No. Absolutely not. Am I open to having a little more routine and being mindful of my eating for a few months  Yes  I am. ⁣
⁣
The process is important  as is the purpose. But if those two things align you can achieve things without falling down a slippery slope of restriction and self hatred. ⁣
⁣
I hope this offload in some way resonates with some of you. No  I’m not going to be sharing every meal or tracking macros. But if you’re interested in my approach I’m happy to share more if it is something you’re interested in. "

So  I know many of you like to stay active whilst you’re away. I’m the same. I actually have more time and more energy to train when I’m away as I don’t do much else except lounge around all day so it’s nice to get my body moving at some point during the day. ⁣
⁣
Unless you’re staying at a super duper hotel  most hotel gyms will have a skeleton set of equipment. Namely some dumbbells  perhaps a bench  a Swiss ball  and usually some rogue machines that you’re never quite sure of.⁣
⁣
When it comes to my training whilst I’m away I am flexible and adapt my sessions depending on what I’ve got access too. ⁣
⁣
I will usually focus most of my training around using dumbbells as they’re most versatile  some body weight movements and some cardio. ⁣
⁣
Here is an example of a workout I did yesterday that you can try either at your gym or whilst you’re away  ⁣
⁣
1. Deadlifts - you could use dumbbells here and do an RDL variation. 4x8 ⁣
2. RFE split squat. 3x8 each side ⁣

Abs or having a low body fat don’t   health or fitness. ⁣

Instagram is full of people pulling their leggings down and showing their lean physiques. And that’s fine. I was there  I did that for likes and validation. ⁣

A much requested video on my key coaching tips for a barbell RDL.

An RDL or Romanian deadlift is an exercise designed to work your posterior chain  namely your hamstrings and glutes as well as your lower  middle and upper back. It’s a real bang for your buck exercise  but one that I often see done wrong so I thought I’d share some tips to help you nail your RDL. 

1. The RDL is a hip hinge exercise  so you’re looking for maximum bend or flexion from the hips. As you can see in the above video  my first movement is to push the hips back keeping a soft bend in the knee. If you’re struggling with this  remove any load and just practice closing a door with your butt. Push the hips back and then stand upright again and that is essentially your hip hinge. 

2. The RDL is not about how flexible you are. This is almost always the mistake I see the most. The exercise is not about how low you can do  and actually in doing this you’re likely hitting way more lower back than hamstrings and glutes which doesn’t always make for a happy spine. Rather than aiming for your maximal range of motion  the goal should be optimal range of motion with the torso slightly above parallel to the floor and a hip joint angle that’s close to 90 degrees as shown above. 

3. Maintain a rigid and neural spine. This neutral spinal position includes a very slight natural arch although not excessive  a tightly braced core… Think stomach pulled in  chest out  shoulders pinned back  rib cage pulled down and in  scapula pulled down  head tall and most importantly chin tucked as if you’re holding an orange underneath it  rather than cocking the neck forwards. 

4. Keep the weight close to your centre of mass. One of my favourite cues is to imagine you’re scraping the barbell down the fronts of your legs. Of course  please don’t actually hurt yourself  but keeping the barbell really tight to yourself allows to keep a solid centre of mass which will help to place significantly more tension on the glutes and hamstrings and far less strain on the lower back.

I’ve been a  womens aid ambassador for over four years now. I have experienced first hand the devastation that domestic abuse can cause. And today I got to speak in Parliament about my experience  and to ask for more support and better funding for survivors of domestic abuse. ⁣
⁣
To say this is a proud moment is truly an understatement. Did 16 year old Alice who was attacked at school  who had to go to court  who experienced abusive behaviour that I hope nobody else has to ever experience think that one day she’d be here  Sat  with Mel B another incredible survivor and patron of Women’s Aid  talking to the people that have the power to prevent this happening to other women and girls. Never. ⁣
⁣
We need to be realistic about the damage that domestic abuse causes. We need to understand that all victims are not a homogenous group and that they need to be treated in different ways. We need better support for minority communities  those who are disabled and those who are slipping through the cracks of getting the help they deserve. ⁣

460,aliceliveing,influencers,"Coaching a front squat  ⁣
⁣
I’m going to break down the difference between a front and back squat on a separate post  but today I’m talking through my key coaching cues for a front squat. ⁣
⁣
1. SET UP  please always make sure the rack is set at about shoulder height so that you can un-rack and re-rack the bar safely. This is really important  particularly as the loads start to get heavier. ⁣

2. FEET  begin with both feet positioned under the bar  before standing straight and stepping back in to your solid squat position. The bar should aim to remain around the mid foot for the entirety of your front squat to keep balanced and allow for full drive through the entirety of the foot. ⁣

3. ELBOWS  as you lower down in to the squat  it’s important to drive the elbows and chest upright to keep the torso upright and remain balanced. A nice cue is to imagine you’re showing a logo on your sports bra to someone in front of you. If you struggle with wrist/shoulder mobility here  this will be a struggle and opting for a cross grip may be safer for you. ⁣

4. BREATH  bracing in a front squat is important to create a rigid trunk that will help to support the spine. Inhale at the top  hold and support as you lower and exhale as you drive up from the bottom. ⁣

5. SAFETY  the front squat isn’t something I’d use with beginners. As always  context is key when it comes to training and just because your fave on instagram does it  doesn’t mean it’s necessarily right for you. Begin with the basics of goblet squats first before you launch yourself in to front squats  and as always build the load up from something very tolerable so you hone the movement before going heavy. ⁣

463,aliceliveing,influencers,"Next week is deload week on my app  and I thought I’d explain why we are taking this week to recover before the March challenge begins. ⁣
⁣
Within training we illicit physical stress to our muscles during our workouts. This process creates small micro tears within our muscles that the body then has to work hard to repair.⁣
⁣
As we then recover by using things like regular rest days and deload weeks  the body adapts and comes back  stronger for the next session or next training block. This is a phenomenon commonly known as supercompensation.⁣
⁣
If you’re rolling through your workouts without taking small breaks and push too hard for too long  it is far more likely that you can experience injuries  a drop in immune function  an increase in injuries  low mood  low libido  hormonal disruption and more. ⁣
⁣
But  a deload week doesn’t mean doing absolutely nothing either. It’s simply a week where we pull back on the volume and reduce the intensity of our training which allows the body to recover before pushing hard again for the March challenge. ⁣
⁣
So next week there will be 3 workouts dropping on Monday  Wednesday and Friday that are all 30 minute full body workouts that are there to keep you moving without placing too much stress on the body. ⁣
⁣
Then  March 7th my new STRONG challenge commences  and it’s going to be mega. ⁣

In this exercise the sole purpose was to improve the quality of the movement and the speed of the movement. Between video 1 and 2 is a few weeks  and the improvement is evident. ⁣
⁣
So many of us focus on a linear journey of the weights simply going up and up  but our bodies don’t always respond in that way. ⁣

⁣
I’m about to turn 29 and with it being my last year of my 20’s I am looking back on all I’ve learnt throughout the last 10 years. ⁣
⁣
Looking back  I feel some deep sadness for the person I became early on my in twenties. I’ve been able to work through a lot of what I experienced and whilst I regret so much of what I did  I am also able to understand that I was a product of the environment so many of us found ourselves in  and I’m able to offer myself compassion for being naive and not knowing better. ⁣
⁣
My late twenties have been so much clearer. I have energy for joy  I have a love for life  I have a partner I adore  I have a job I feel grateful every day to be able to do. ⁣

472,aliceliveing,influencers,"This morning  it’s all about the deadlift  ⁣
⁣
Why do I take my shoes off when I deadlift  In the first video you can see that the shoes lift my heels which makes it much harder to ‘sit back’ in to my deadlift. With my hips sitting higher than my shoulders I have to work much harder to drive up in to the deadlift  and the bar path is ‘off’ as it pulls forwards first before I can pull up. ⁣
⁣
In the second video with my shoes off I’m able to really sit back in to my deadlift. This makes it far easier to work through my posterior chain to get the bar up. In addition as the bar sits directly under my armpits the bar path is better too as it’s able to come straight up and down. With my shoes off  I’m also able to feel far more grounded and stable in my deadlift which helps with power in the movement.⁣
⁣
So my key tips for deadlifting  ⁣
⁣
1. Shoes off OR very flat trainers. ⁣
2. Armpits above the barbell.⁣
3. Imagine your squeezing oranges under your armpits right before you lift up off the floor. ⁣
4. Shins touching the barbell. ⁣
5. Barbell over mid foot. ⁣
6. Angle of hips to shoulders slopes up. ⁣
⁣
It’s worth adding here that not everyone will be able to achieve the above deadlifting from the floor. For many people  lever length  mobility  lifting experience etc can mean that deadlifting from boxes or from a rack can be far more helpful in allowing you to achieve the positioning described above. ⁣

Push ups  ⁣
⁣
When coaching push ups  I always use the elastic band analogy. If I pulled an elastic band tight  where would the weakest part be  ⁣
⁣
The middle  ⁣
⁣
So imagine that when you’re doing your push ups  you’re so focused on the upper body component that you forget our middle  ie our weakest spot  needs attention too.⁣
⁣
Lumbopelvic control simply means the control of the lumbopelvic region. I coach this with clients in exercises such as dead bugs and planks for example. ⁣
⁣
In a push up  what I tend to see is peoples pelvis drooping down towards the floor which actually makes the exercise harder. ⁣
⁣
Next time you do your push ups focus on these three things  ⁣
⁣
1. Elbows out like an arrow ⁣
2. Piece of string pulling you up from your belly button towards the ceiling ⁣
3. Inhale as you lower  exhale as you drive up ⁣

⁣
Todays gym session didn’t go according to plan. I felt a lot ‘weaker’  I noticed my grip strength struggled  and I felt less motivated than usual.⁣
⁣
I checked where I am in my cycle and noticed I’m in my luteal phase. This occurs after ovulation and is where progesterone rises significantly. ⁣
⁣
During this phase of your cycle you may find that you don t have as much endurance. You may not be able to hit max lifts or match what you were able to do in your follicular phase  and may feel less motivated to train. ⁣
⁣
What’s empowering is knowing that as women  we can work with our cycle to get the most from our training. I scaled back todays session and focused on just moving my body at a lower intensity  instead of pushing through. ⁣
⁣
So if you’re noticing that your training progress isn’t linear month on month  don’t beat yourself up. We have hormonal fluctuations to contend with that can affect progress so just work with where you’re at and don’t beat yourself up if you didn’t hit a session as hard as you wanted to  ⁣

⁣
So why do I sometimes train barefoot  ⁣
⁣
Weight training in almost every closed chain exercise requires stability at the foot. These running trainers  whilst trendy  unfortunately have a lot of ‘bulk’ and make it very difficult for me to stabilise in this movement. ⁣
⁣
Our feet set the groundwork for the stability of our entire structure  so wearing the right footwear to lift can really make a difference. ⁣
⁣
Choosing something that is flat and sturdy  Nike Met Cons are a great example  will help the foot to stabilise.⁣
⁣
For those who are more advanced  training barefoot can be another great option as you allow the foot to really work to stabilise. Our feet are inherently mobile with over 25 bones spread across 4 different joints  and the foot is capable of a lot of movement. When our feet are in big bulky shoes  we inhibit the foot from doing what we want it to do which is working for us to support the movement. ⁣
⁣
So  next time you head to the gym just give your footwear a check and see if maybe opting for something flatter and more sturdy might be a better option "

My ethos is all about working WITH your body. Not against it. If waking yourself up at 5.30am to work out is making you feel miserable  what are the chances you’re able to stick to that habit long term  ⁣

Our bodies will naturally have a sleep rhythm that hopefully works for us. Sometimes you can disrupt or change that rhythm for the better  but sometimes  it’s actually better to lean in to when YOU feel most motivated or awake to train  rather than forcing yourself in to an early start that your body just doesn’t want to do. ⁣

496,aliceliveing,influencers,"Abuse is not love. ⁣
⁣
Did you know that an estimated  although this figure is likely far greater  2.3 million people experienced domestic abuse last year  ⁣
⁣
The number of police recorded domestic abuse-related crimes in England and Wales rose 6  in the year ending March 2021 to 845 734. ⁣
⁣
The numbers continue to rise  and women continue to be victims of interpersonal violence and abuse. ⁣
⁣
Tonight I sat on an incredibly important panel with  yslbeauty and  womensaid to discuss my own experiences of abuse  alongside an incredible panel of experts. We talked at length about how we can be better ally’s and better support women who experience abuse  as well as how to understand the key warning signs that might indicate a relationship is abusive. ⁣
⁣
Not every relationship turns violent  but knowing the red flags to be aware of allows for more and more women to be supported and to speak up before things may turn bad. ⁣
⁣
I feel so incredibly privileged to be in a position where I have almost fully recovered from my own trauma and am able to speak and share my story in the hope that it helps others. ⁣
⁣
Thank you for hosting such an important conversation  salihughes and to the other panellists  phoenixisphoenix  Farrah Nazeer CEO of  womens aid and Jane Monckton Smith. ⁣

497,aliceliveing,influencers,"How to build a strength session  ⁣
⁣
Whilst I would love for you all to download my app  I realise it isn’t for everyone so I thought I’d share some tips on how you can build your own strength workouts for yourself. ⁣
⁣
Step 1  a warm up/session primer ⁣
This is designed to prepare your body for the session ahead. Choose movements that mimic or are similar to the pattern of what you’re doing in your session. ⁣
⁣
Step 2  a priority lift ⁣
This/these are your key lifts that are generally compound movements such as squats  deadlifts push or pull variations. I’d suggest that this movement you ramp up to  so two ramping sets and 3-4 working sets aiming to build quality in the movement and gradually increase the load. ⁣
⁣
Step 3  assistance lifts ⁣
These complement your priority lift and generally help to improve technical or muscular weaknesses in your main lift. I’d suggest choosing between 1-3 of these to help improve your main exercise above. ⁣
⁣
Step 3  accessory lifts ⁣
These work on any weaknesses you might have  and any ‘extra’ areas you want to focus on. These can also be used to address strength imbalances and/or work on smaller unilateral movements that maybe aren’t covered in the above. ⁣
⁣
I hope this helps you to understand a little clearer how to structure a session and gives you guidance as to how to build a programme that will work for you. ⁣

⁣
I know this is partly due to Instagram pushing the idea that perfection is the norm  I know that these feelings will pass  I know that my skin will calm down  but it still feels challenging. ⁣
⁣
I’ve got an appointment with  anjalimahto in a few weeks to discuss potentially going on roaccutane. This isn’t a step I take lightly  but having spent years struggling and feeling the horrible self consciousness of skin flare ups  it feels right to explore the option. ⁣

⁣
No  health isn’t this simple  but for most people focusing on these big things can be far more helpful than worrying about the tiny less important stuff. ⁣
⁣
If you want to spend January still prioritising your well-being then these are the easy winds I’d focus on  ⁣
⁣
1. Get outside and walk for at least 20 minutes every day. It doesn’t have to be all in one go  but you could break it down in to manageable 10 minute chunks during your day. ⁣

2. Sleep is often the most underrated aspect of our health. Prioritising good quality sleep every night can make you feel more energised  more motivated and help you to recover better from your training. ⁣

3. Weight train 3x per week. Ok ok  I’m biased here but I really believe in the importance of weight training for everyone. No  that doesn’t have to be lifting heavy heavy weights but some form of resistance training 3x a week can make a huge difference. ⁣

4. Minimise stress where possible. This is far easier said that done  but implementing some coping strategies to help you manage stress can be a really easy win. Try some guided meditation or breath work during your day or before bed to wind down and reduce stress. ⁣

5. We all know drinking water is important but this is just an extra reminder. Check your pee when you go to the loo to have a rough indication of how hydrated you are. It’s easy to forget to drink during the colder winter months so maybe try herbal teas or flavoured water if you’re struggling. ⁣

Feeling our best doesn’t have to be crazy complicated. Try not to stress too much and just focus on the big stuff that will make the most difference ⁣"

506,aliceliveing,influencers,"How did I become a morning person  ⁣
⁣
As the dark mornings make it increasingly less motivating to get out of bed in the morning  i though I’d share some of the things that help me get up and get moving early in the day. ⁣
⁣
1. Have a consistent bed time and wake time every day  even on weekends  Staying consistent with your bed time and wake time allows your body to fall in to a regular rhythm with knowing when to wind down and when to wake. If you’re constantly changing when you go to bed  and staying in bed a lot longer on certain days this can make it much harder to wake up early on the days you need to. ⁣

2. Avoid caffeine later in the day. This might sound obvious but avoiding caffeinated drinks later in the day is another easy way to ensure your sleep pressure rises naturally throughout the day and encourages you to feel sleepy in the evenings. Too much caffeine  even in things like tea and chocolate can impact your ability to feel sleepy naturally and therefore makes falling asleep much harder. ⁣

3. Make sure your phone isn’t the last thing you look at before bed  or the first thing you look at in the morning. I put my phone on aeroplane mode from around 9pm each evening and it makes a definite ‘end’ to my day. I then try and read before bed as this really helps me to wind down and feel sleepy. ⁣

4. Get outside in to natural light as early as possible. With the dark mornings it is easy to not see any proper day light throughout the day  but getting natural light helps to regulate our circadian rhythm which is what helps us to rise and fall to sleep. Getting daylight is crucial and I always aim to be outdoors in some capacity during the early hours of the day. ⁣

5. Do not snooze your alarm. I know this one is painful  but snoozing your alarm is not helping you get more sleep or make your mornings easier. It’s actually just prolonging the decision to get up. Try your hardest to wake to your first alarm. Or reduce snoozes to one and then none. I promise you this really helps. ⁣

509,aliceliveing,influencers,"I guess the thing that I want you to really think about is what happens after the transformation photo. ⁣
⁣
In essence  the easy part is the transformation. A calorie deficit works for most people  paired with an increase in energy expenditure  and for those who have never previously dieted or worked in this way  their bodies will change. Snap. A moment in time. A career built off the success of these ‘transformations’. ⁣
⁣
But what happens after the transformation  What happens when the calorie deficit doesn’t work in the way it did  or when real life starts to creep back in and your body doesn’t quite look how it did in your before and after photo. ⁣
⁣
What happens when your energy starts to dip as you try to drop your calories lower  ⁣
⁣
Or when your libido and menstrual cycle are impacted because your body then has to exist on less calories than it needs to function optimally  ⁣
⁣
Or when you’re having to do A LOT of exercise without adequate recovery to keep the results that were once easy to maintain. ⁣
⁣
You see  transformations are really the easy part. And they’re what the fitness industry wants you to focus on. But what I’m about it what happens after the photo. ⁣
⁣
How do you maintain training year round  and not just for a short period of time. How do you keep yourself motivated when you’ve hit your goal. How do you optimise health rather than the aesthetic you achieved in the photo.⁣
⁣
This January it’s easy to be sucked in to taking a photo where you feel terrible and then comparing it to your ‘after’  but I want you to start thinking beyond that. Because results are in reality much harder to maintain. When it comes to long term health and happiness  that usually resides in a body that is a little less lean than your ‘after’. It usually means unlearning the strict calorie deficit ideas you once used and instead requires a focus on improving your relationship with food  with exercise and with yourself. ⁣
⁣
You see  my before here is a life not lived. A life of regime and control and obsession. And my after is my body sitting where it comfortably sits. No it’s not always a body I love  yes I still have days where I feel uncomfortable… cont. "

547,aliceliveing,influencers,"WHY YOU MOVE. ⁣
⁣
Nobody can kick start your motivation for you. I can show up for my classes  I can shout at you to keep going  but in reality  it’s YOU who needs to show up for YOU. ⁣
⁣
So  why do you move  What makes you get out of bed  throw on your gym kit and grab your dumbbells or lace up your trainers  ⁣
⁣
Defining your personal motivations to move can be a really helpful way to keep you motivated to exercise. ⁣
⁣
1. When we see exercise beyond the outdated narrative of solely being there to lose weight  we can appreciate the far reaching health benefits that regular exercise brings. For my audience of majority females  weight training can be particularly beneficial for our physical health as a way to increase bone density for example and reduce the risk of osteoporosis which is more prevalent in women. Often the health benefits  if not weight loss  can be less tangible  but having this in your mind can be a helpful way to even encourage you out on a walk on a lazy day. ⁣

2. How do you feel after exercising  For me  knowing that I feel a million dollars post workout is what gets me through. That post workout high  the feeling of moving feels so empowering and this is always something to try and focus on when motivating yourself to workout.  
⁣
3. Show up for your community. If you’re really struggling  are you able to team up with a friend or a group of friends who can all help to keep each other accountable  Ultimately the decision still has to come from you to move  but having someone you don’t want to let down in the equation can help. ⁣

4. Move to music. GET YOUR FAVOURITE PLAYLIST BLASTING and I promise you’ll want to move. ⁣

5. Move outdoors. A combination of movement and nature works wonders for our mental health. If a home/gym workout just isn’t motivating you  why not get outside and move. ⁣

6. Create weekly targets. Is it to walk for 30 mins a day  or to exercise 3 times a week  Recording your movement and setting targets can keep you engaged in moving long term. ⁣
⁣
What other ways do you motivate yourself  and why do you choose to move "
548,aliceliveing,influencers,"Sometimes a review deserves a whole post of its own. ⁣
⁣

549,aliceliveing,influencers,"Exercise and Perimenopause. ⁣
⁣
This week on the blog I am delighted to welcome our latest contributor  themenopausemedic who shares her first post on exercise and perimenopause. ⁣
⁣
When I was building the app  I knew that I wanted to ensure my app catered to women of ALL ages and not just those in my age bracket. ⁣
⁣
I strongly believe  and evidence also supports  that women embracing some form of resistance training particularly throughout their menopause journey can help both physical and mental health and I wanted my app to be an accessible destination for women of any age to embrace lifting weights in a structured and supported way. ⁣
⁣
Covering the menopause has been an important pillar of the app and I’m so excited to have Dr Barton sharing her advice on how to navigate the perimenopause and what small changes you can make that can have a big difference to how you feel. ⁣

Please do give Dr Barton a follow  and if you’re an app user you can find the blog post in our education section now. ⁣

550,aliceliveing,influencers,"Some weekend outfits from the last few days  ⁣
⁣
I got a message today from a lovely lady who said that she felt really uncomfortable as none of her clothes fit. ⁣
⁣
It was a feeling I could absolutely resonate with. I now sit roughly around a size 10 although this can vary wildly depending on brands. At my smallest I was a size 6 and there was so much I attached to this number. ⁣
⁣
It is difficult to begin to unravel the attachment we have to numbers.⁣
⁣
It is challenging to try on clothes you’ve worn and felt great in that no longer fit. ⁣
⁣
But we are not put on this earth to remain the same size or weight for our entire lives. ⁣
⁣
Our bodies change  grow  evolve as we do  and those numbers can become so arbitrary and irrelevant if you learn to detach yourself from giving them any meaning or worth. ⁣
⁣
I really love my fashion now. I adore clothes and I love nothing more than putting on a nice outfit. But I now buy clothes that fit me and that FEEL amazing. I order whatever size will fit me best  rather than trying to opt for the smallest size and then hating myself if it doesn’t fit. ⁣
⁣
I’ve charity shopped or sold my entire ‘old me’ wardrobe and replaced it with clothes that I love and that serve me and my body where I’m at right now. ⁣
⁣
I cannot tell you how cathartic that process was.⁣
⁣
Life should be about you FEELING your best. Wearing the clothes that make you feel amazing. ⁣
⁣
So if you’re having a wobble this weekend because something doesn’t fit  please don’t waste any more time beating yourself up as if you’ve somehow failed. ⁣
⁣
You haven’t. Your body is evolving as you do  and your clothes DO NOT define your worth. ⁣
⁣
You are so much more than the numbers that we crazily hold ourselves to. ⁣
⁣
I hope this resonates with someone today "

⁣
A few key take homes  ⁣
⁣
 Initiate the movement from the floor and let the floor absorb the force at the end of the given rep range. ⁣
⁣
 imagine you’ve got an orange under your chin throughout to keep long through the cervical spine. ⁣
⁣
 don’t bend at the arms  but keep a soft slight bend in them throughout ⁣
⁣
 don’t overly drive the hips through. Think about squeezing under rather than through with the pelvis. ⁣

I hope this helps team. As always my classes are about coaching you properly and making sure you do movements safely and to the best of your ability  ⁣

565,aliceliveing,influencers,"AD   With electric cars being the future  I am so excited to have teamed up with  volvocaruk to explore their new fully electric XC40 Recharge. I’m sure I’m not alone in feeling acutely aware of my impact on the environment  and whilst I know that I alone cannot change the world  I truly believe that small changes add up to big results. ⁣
⁣
Having previously been sceptical of the ease of having an electric car  I can honestly say I’ve been so pleasantly surprised by how quickly we adapted to using it  and I can now never see myself going back to a petrol car. ⁣
⁣
Things I personally love  ⁣
⁣
It looks bloody fab. I like to think I am someone who has an eye for style and I love that the car looks and feels so luxury. We opted for all black exterior and interior which looks smart and is easy to maintain  and the spacious interior and large interactive screen are nice extra details. ⁣
One charge will last me up to two weeks. Driving in London means I’m not doing long trips and so one charge can usually last me two weeks which makes it really easy and convenient  259 miles .⁣

When we’ve taken the car on longer journey’s  it automatically informs us of the fastest places to charge the car on route and how long they will take. When we recently drove to Yorkshire it was so helpful being shown our best charging spots  whether they were free and how long they’d take to charge the car. ⁣

Finding a charge point is way more simple than I’d thought. There are now countless apps to show you your nearest charge points  and if I’ve ever needed to stop to charge it’s been such an easy process. As more and more people convert to electric vehicles  the more charge points there will be and we will eventually all adjust to this new way of getting around. ⁣

I do feel that it’s a change we are able to make to improve our impact on the environment. I’m not saying it’s perfect  but having a car was something we felt we needed and so opting to go electric was the best option. Alongside other lifestyle changes I do believe this can make a big difference."

We are one week in to my October challenge and I hope you’re all feeling good. When I built the app  I wanted it to be a platform that helped anyone and everyone enjoy their training. Not only do we focus on physical strength  but I truly believe my style of coaching helps you to understand the WHY behind your workouts  and creates a sustainable and achievable programme that anyone can do and see results from. ⁣

If you’ve any questions about my app  my challenges  or working out in general I’ll spend some time going through these today so drop your question below and I will come back to you ASAP "
573,aliceliveing,influencers,"Morning team  As we haven’t got any core challenges in this months challenge I thought I’d share some of my favourite core exercises for you to try this week  ⁣
⁣
When it comes to your core  try and think beyond crunch variations. So much of our core strength also comes from our hips and glutes  our ability to have control over the movement of our pelvis  our ability to rotate etc so endless crunch variations don’t really serve us well. Our core is a cylinder with our pelvic floor at the bottom  our diaphragm at the top  and our rectus abdominus and obliques making up the central part. With this in mind  only utilising one aspect of our core in one movement pattern means you’re forgetting all of the other movements the core does for us like our ability to rotate  resist rotation  laterally flex  flexion and extension. ⁣
⁣
Instead  why not try adding some of these in to your training and feel the benefits of what a strong core can do ⁣
⁣
1. Table top shoulder taps ⁣
2. Plank saws ⁣
3. Bicycle crunches ⁣
4. Side plank March ⁣
5. Plank single arm row ⁣

587,aliceliveing,influencers,The perfect end to a perfect trip with you   we finally got a photo  
588,aliceliveing,influencers,"Stretch marks  skin texture  rolls where we don’t want them. These are all things I’ve hated my body for. ⁣
⁣
For as far back as I can remember I’ve hated my boobs. I was happy when they all but disappeared when I was tiny  but naturally as I gained weight they came back too. ⁣
⁣
As I lie round the pool on my holiday I remind myself that almost every woman around this pool will also have their own insecurities. Every woman  even the ones who we tell ourselves are ‘perfect’ have hang ups about their bodies. And the amount of energy  the hours spent worrying and wasting time thinking if I only we could change ourselves  we’d be happier. I wonder what we could do if we reclaimed even a bit of that time. I don’t have all the answers when it comes to body confidence. I’ve definitely had moments where I’ve felt great on this holiday and moments that I haven’t. But I try and remind myself each time a negative thought enters my mind that my body is my body  and I’ve only got one. I could choose to waste years being at war with it  or I could choose peace and an opportunity to focus all of those energies elsewhere and in to far more rewarding things. ⁣
⁣
We weren’t put on this earth to be perfect. We all have things that society has told us are ‘bad’  stretch marks  cellulite  bits that wobble and jiggle in the way that our bodies are meant to. But isn’t that the beautiful thing about us all  Unique  imperfect beings. ⁣

595,aliceliveing,influencers,"I think the hardest part for me was that so much of my identity was wrapped up in being small. ⁣
⁣
I enjoyed the feeling of walking in to the gym or a room and people comment on my body.⁣
⁣
I loved being able to fit in to any clothes I wanted to wear and always being the smallest size. ⁣
⁣
I found so much validation in people telling me I looked amazing  that I didn’t really feel I brought anything else to the table.⁣
⁣
What’s resulted from this is that I’ve had to work so hard to love me for me  regardless of the body I inhabit. I’ve been smaller and I’ve been bigger  and across my lifetime my body will expand and change in many ways I hope  and I need to be ok with knowing that regardless of this  I am a good person who deserves love from both myself and others.⁣
⁣
It feels a lot easier to write the above than it does to put it in to practice  but I’m working my hardest to do the work and to get to a place of acceptance and neutrality. ⁣
⁣
I know that so many of you on here have been in smaller bodies  and still sometimes find themselves yearning for all that that body brought. It’s not an easy thing to walk away from so I guess this is just my way of saying I hear you  I empathise  and you are SO much more than your body I promise "

707,charlottedawsy,influencers,"Monday Motivation this week - is Chuffin meeee Chazza   I just can’t believe how confident I feel in my bikini this summer. A year ago and I would have been there with my old friend - my chunkeh but funkeh belly and you know me  I’d have been having a laff but… now I just feel like I’m the absolute best version of myself having lost all that timber. Over 3 stone ffs   But the most important thing is I’m dead healthy now and am gonna be around for years to come to see my Noah grow up and be the best mumma I can for him.

Am not saying it was all a walk in the park when the doctors told me I needed to get in shape or I’d be on course for Type 2 diabetes like my dad  but finding a way to lose the jelleh belleh while having fun has been amazing. Plus I can still have a good time on my jollies knowing I can still enjoy a drink and my favourite grub and keep in shape. 

So if you’re looking for the motivation to get yourself bikini confident - check out my beltin Belleh Blaster diet and fitness plan  via the link in my bio or go to bellehblaster.com  You know you want to …

Thankfully I was able to do it without starving myself or over doing it in the gym. I’ve been helped by some amazing people and found a way that helped me lose over 3 Stone and still eat all the sexeh grub I love..

It’s been really tough time as you can imagine but am trying to get back to a bit of my normal life.. I put my gym gear on today thinking I might do a little workout but to be honest  am not quite ready for anything too demanding right now. But I just wanted to say to all my belleh blaster birds that I’ve not forgotten you..   it honestly always inspires me SO much seeing how you’re all getting on and transforming your health for the better.. 
Anyway as a thank you to you all we’ve got a little giveaway on at the moment. Well quite a big one actually - my fittie fiancé Matthew .. Just joking you don’t actually get him but he does make a guest appearance in our new Bonus Abs workout and we’re giving that plan away for FREE to anyone who signs up for any of our other plans. So a 10 minute Abs Workout to tone and sculpt your stomach.. And before anyone starts trolling me - no I won’t be doing it myself yet. But I do want to start getting back very gently into exercise cos I know how good it is for my mental health.. 
So see what you think my darlings - just click the link and check it out.. you won’t regret it

768,charlottedawsy,influencers,"Hi my darlings  I finally feel ready to post this.. I mean I don’t know when there is a good time to post this. It’s been an extremely tough week mentally but also obviously physically… I am heartbroken beyond words.. and I know I’m never quiet on here    always so open and honest with you guys so it’s been a shock to you all.. I keep getting lots   lots of messages worrying about us all  asking why I’m being quiet   if Noah is ok.. Noah is absolutely fine.. he’s amazing. I’m the one that’s not ok.. unfortunately I’ve suffered with a miscarriage. Obviously our families   close friends have known about me being pregnant  but didn’t announce anything until I got further down the line.. I was so excited to share our happy news with you all. Noah’s little brother or little sister  as you can imagine Matthew   I were absolutely over the moon our little family was going to be growing. I also found out on mother’s day which was just so special. But sometimes it’s just not meant to be  I really thought it was but it just wasn’t this time. Miscarriages are so common   not spoke about enough. We are so heartbroken right now have no words  and just don’t feel Upto posting being my happy silly self right now.. 
also please can people stop sending Matthew   I nasty messages about our parenting skills. I clearly show and say far too much  we are bloody good parents and Noah is so loved and is our life. And these horrible forums talking about us  these trolls are just awful but they won’t win..  any nasty vile comments I get on here about this you will be getting blocked and reported. 

Thank you for all your love   support always  I don’t ever want to let go of Noah..  I feel so lucky to have Noah  one day we will get our rainbow baby.. "

777,charlottedawsy,influencers," Warning  This is not a Before   After It’s a During   After  

I’d already shifted about a stone of timber before I filmed the one on the left - a little jiggy bit from my Sexeh Showgirl Sweat routine. As you can see I was pretty rubbish at it. I seriously needed a rest break every other minute  But I loved doing it  having a laff dancing round my deck. Not giving a chuffing damn what anyone thought 

And that’s me on the right after losing another 2 stone and more. Never doing it for the look - although that’s a bonus ngl - but doing it for the feel. Feeling good about myself  feeling confident in my clothes and feeling dead sexeh in my body

So if you fancy having a giggle while you jiggle and getting into the best shape evs  join in the fun with me and my Mrs Motivator   sophiemaggie  and my fittie fiancé  matt sarsfield 

Our beltin 6 week slim down for the summer - Bikini Blaster - is out now. Just click on the link in my bio and get ready to enjoy a few Easter treats guilt free

So frankly it’s a miracle we manage to get a bit of slap on now and then and look half alive  Even though 4we all know it’s SO worth it for a cheekeh smile and them baby giggles..

814,charlottedawsy,influencers,"Ohh come ere yewww hope your fancying me on this video Matthew whilst I’m sat in me pjs looking not like this
Feeling a little bit proud of me self that I’ve been able to wear bikinis like this on my holibobs.. 

You know me  I never let my chunkeh but funkeh belleh get in the way of a good time. But I must say my confidence was through the chuffin roof in this last holiday. And I know a lot of that was down to getting my arse into gear and getting into the best shape but most importantly feeling fabulous on the inside too.. 

Losing over 3 stone wasn’t easy - I had days  and weeks  when I couldn’t be arsed to get off the sofa but I knew I had to do it for my little fambo.. get healthy   change my lifestyle.. 
And honestly there’s no way I’d have been able to run around after Noah on this holiday - or wear all those fabulous outfits  - if I hadn’t shifted all that timber.. and got fit n healthy  

So my darlings if you’re sat there feeling you know you should but finding it tough to get motivated - I really want to help you get there. And join the thousands of beautiful birds who’ve lost weight on my beltin Belleh Blaster plan. We’ve still got a  20 off deal  so click the chuffin link in my bio  - and start your transformation now. Then send me pics of you on your holidays feeling sexeh in your bikinis or cozzies..

Just thought I’d share a bit of Sunday night inspo for anyone who’s thinking it’s about time they got their chuffin arsesss into gear got a bit healthier fitter and change your lifestyle just in time for summer 

Honestly I really couldn’t even do one sit up when I started on this journey just a few months ago. I really do know what it’s like to feel that you’re never going to be able to change your eating habits and actually enjoy exercising. Matthew used to joke that the only exercise I did was walk to the fridge  He wasn’t far off. And half the time I used to eat without even thinking what was going in my mouth. But now I’ve found a balance so I can go away  have a good time and know that I can get back on it again with my silly sweateh workouts and a diet that is dead easy to follow and has yummy ‘normal’ sexeh grub on it..

So please don’t ever give up on yourself and feel you can never do it. If I can do it you chuffin can   Even if you have a lot to lose like I did - you can just take it one day at a time and you will get there I pinky promise. And I am so incredibly proud of all the thousands of you who are getting amazing results too following my Belleh Blaster plan. In fact most are doing better than I did - it took me 6 months to lose 3 Stone and we’ve had gorgeous gals losing 2 Stone in 8 weeks   

We’ve still got 20 smackers off my beltin plan so check it out and start your transformation today. Just click the LINK IN MY BIO  you won’t regret it

If the answer is yes  absolutely add that to your wardrobe. It’s really stuck with me   this coat has been glued on since I got it.

This time last year I was in A E hooked up on a drip with a giant pillow of drugs   liquids after being sick over 20 times in 12 hours. I left the hospital with a prescription for cyclizine. That unfortunately did nothing. ⁣
I was then back in for an overnight stay   they moved me onto prochloperazine which did the opposite of making me feel better  I won’t go into too much detail as I don’t want to affect those who are currently taking it  ⁣
Around 28 weeks I was admitted again after tearing an intercostal muscle from the endless vomiting   that’s when I was introduced to my golden ticket  ondansetron. It melted on my tongue   tasted like bubblegum  It was absolutely worth the agonising constipation   I ended up having to be on another 3 different types of pills on top of that but it got me through until the very end⁣    the 6 days postparty when I was still feeling but not being sick

21 weeks of making milkshakes   I would love your help/guidance please. If you exclusively breastfed  did you ever introduce a bottle or did the nip do the round trip  
Rae took one when she was 3 weeks old for 4 nights but it completely changed her way of sucking   I found the pumping/prep on top of breastfeeding was just another thing to add to the endless checklist of the new job. So now I’m 5 months in   the longest we’ve spent away from each other is 2 hours. I genuinely don’t want to be apart from her any longer than that but even going to the dentist the other day for a root canal was a game of countdown.

it seems there’s a formula to follow when posting on Instagram but there’s so much more behind the photo. Hours of pushing or major surgery - the grittiness of birth needs more airtime. Thank you  frida uk for leading the conversation on  realbirthannouncements

here’s my guide to prepare yourself for the day of your caesarean 

if you can  go for a walk/waddle on your way to hospital. Even if it’s just for 10 minutes  park the car somewhere as green as you can find   fill up your fresh air tank.

you may have been given a time slot for when you’ll be meeting your tiny bundle of deliciousness but relinquish all expectations as you have no control over that. I kept repeating “you’ve waited 40 weeks  you can wait a few extra hours”

instead of clock watching whilst your tummy is rumbling  do whatever you need to do to laugh through the hunger   anticipation. There were quite a few emergency caesareans on our day so Mat   I became ballet  samba  flamenco   break dancers all whilst wearing our surgical outfits. 

when you get into your surgery room  it may feel like there are a lot of people but just think every single person is there to look after you - they are your army of support. 

ask to hold your midwives hand during your epidural if your partner isn’t allowed to  mat wasn’t because of restrictions    ask them to keep talking to you whilst you breeeeeeath. AND no one told me my face would feel itchy   tingly  it’s a strange sensation but if you’re ready for it  you’re ready to embrace it.

if you’re allowed  have your partner take mini clips leading up to the arrival   your babies entry into the world.  I underestimated how drugged up I was going to be   the whole experience is scrambled in my brain so I watch them back    cry every single time . They are indescribably special   you will treasure them forever

  finally. You are allowed to mourn that ‘dream birth’ you created in your brain but you are absolutely not allowed to think for one second that you are less of a champion than every one of your friends who has given birth vaginally."

⁣
I haven’t worn any since my virtual ‘hen night’ in May 2020   I’ve honestly loved stripping down to being bare faced. So the thought of wearing it for the wedding actually feels bizarre. If I told myself 2 years ago I’d be thinking of not wearing it for my wedding day I would’ve laughed   thought that was utterly ridiculous. I absolutely loved doing my gold shmokey eye   playing around with products but now looking back  I worried more about how I looked with makeup on than I do now without any. I would be constantly thinking ‘are they staring at my eyeshadow  maybe it’s smudged ’ or ‘is my lipliner too much  ’

I don’t know if it’s just an age thing ⁣
or that I’ve just become more comfortable being the rawest form of myself ⁣
or that after 7 years of battling acne   hiding it under makeup  I associate it with that - ‘covering up’. Probably a cocktail of all 3    it genuinely ate up an hour  of my day  I now A don’t have that extra free hour   B can do so much more than splatter my face with layers of foundation  
⁣
How my face looks at the wedding is the least important thing of the entire day/my entire life. Especially after shuffling the day from 2020 to 2021 to 2022   I just want to be able to squuuuueze every single person on the day  so hard   I don’t want to even have to think about/worry about getting makeup on anyone’s dress/shirt/suit.⁣

I know I’m not alone in experiencing this  but at the time I felt alone  like my brain had been hijacked   it was pretty distressing. Saying it out loud sounded bizarre   I held back on trying to explain it to my friends for weeks but once I did  so many of them said they had experienced it in the first few weeks of parenthood - the reassuring words ‘your body is reprogramming   rewiring for your new job. Add a dollop of sleep deprivation   you’ll feel like you’re on high alert 24/7 but I promise it calms down’    it did  around week 4  I haven’t heard it since   The support they gave me was invaluable   I soon learnt that a pair of hands to help   a set of ears to listen are two of the most unbeatable gifts you can give a new mother  in real life or over the phone.⁣⁣⁣

981,chessieking,influencers,"LET’S TALK ABOUT SEX  after a  BABY⁣
⁣
on the day of my caesarean  before we’d even met Auraelia  the midwifes asked us what contraception we were planning to use…⁣

⁣
for the first 6 weeks  sex was number 123 on my list of 124 things.  I couldn’t even change my own giant pads myself let alone contort my sawn-in-half body into any page of the karma sutra.⁣
⁣
on Sunday I asked if you felt like there was enough conversation around sex after a caesarean   97  of you said no. I can only speak from my own experience so your sex chronicles  vaginal birth AND sun roof birth are more than welcomed.⁣
⁣
 we tried at 7 weeks  the day after I got ‘my six week sex sign off’   I was absolutely not ready. There’s nothing more encouraging than hearing “ouuuuch  your willy feels like a cheese grater’⁣  I had apparently bought condoms that were pretending to be hedgehogs - ribbed  
we tried again at 8 weeks  it still felt like I’d been glued shut so Mat bought a neon yellow bottle of ‘ylang ylang massage lube’ which did nothing but make the room smell nice. Then we tried at 10 weeks   Hugo decided to take a front row seat  Rae woke up to cheer us on in her crib a metre away  3 minutes in. So  4th time lucky  at 11 weeks we finally managed something that felt as close to sex as possible   here’s a few things that we learnt ⁣
⁣
laughing really helps. ⁣
talking to each other throughout/cheering each other on helps.⁣
pretending it’s the first time you’ve ever had sex with each other helps.⁣
lube helps.⁣
going super slow helps.⁣
silky soft ultra thin condoms help  stay away from ribbed hedgehogs .⁣
time really helps.⁣
experimenting with basic positions then levelling up to spicy ones when you’re ready helps.⁣

994,chessieking,influencers,"MY FAVOURITE 5 FEEDING POSITIONS ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
breastfeeding has been pretty intense  I totally underestimated how challenging it would be especially on top of the pain post-caesarean. Once the cracked bleeding nipperoos healed  I searched for help   started experimenting with different positions with the support   encouragement from Mat  my friends  midwifes   mumma.
⁣⁣⁣
It’s all about working out what works for you both  asking for help   feeling empowered to make your own decisions on how to feed your baby - whether that’s from your boobies  a bottle or a cocktail of both⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
1. if you’re … RECOVERING FROM A CAESAREAN ⁣⁣⁣
lie back   get as comfortable as possible. Have as many pillows as you need under each arm. Make sure your baby’s body is diagonal or along your body so their feet/legs are away from your healing scar.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
2. if you’re … WANTING A HANDSFREE-FEED stack up enough pillows infront of you to bring your baby up to knocker-height. I sit up   cross my legs then lie Rae horizontal on top of her pillow tower. Once she’s latched I’ve got a slither of freedom to do what I want with my arms  ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
3. if you’re … FEEDING AT NIGHT ⁣⁣⁣
lie in bed on your side with a pillow in between your legs   under your head. Have your babies nose at nipple height   lie them on their back. Rae quickly turns onto her side to face me but you can gently encourage them over. With my free hand I make sure she’s on properly   has enough space to breathe through her nose ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
4. if you’re … OUT N’ ABOUT⁣⁣⁣
this requires no pillows or chairs with armrests  just your knee. Straddle their little legs on your leg   once your baby has latched  support with both hands wherever you feel they are the safest.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
  the 5th is not necessarily a position but I feel it’s just as important as the other 4. I found it slightly overwhelming being the sole-feeder  so this is for those that are looking to introduce a bottle feed for support from a partner  friend or family member. I pump around 6pm to get 3oz which she slurrps up around 9   it sends her off for her longest chunk of sleep  which is only 2hrs at the moment but we’ll absolutely take it  ⁣⁣⁣"

I’d feel prouder of myself for being able to do up the buttons on a pair of shorts than I would if I’d completed a big job at work⁣
⁣
for such a huge slice of my life  I was kidnapped by the body image bollocks brigade. My happiness correlated with the sizes of my wardrobe. ⁣
⁣
I have such a vivid memory of going into Brontë’s wardrobe to try on one of her dresses. I was 21  she was 17   as the younger sister she’d always be able to wear my clothes. Being 6ft   a ‘bigger build’  the phrase humans called me again   again  I wasted so many hours trying to unsuccessfully squeeeeze into her outfits.⁣
That morning I remember the grumble of my hungry tummy which was the soundtrack to those years. I slipped the dress over my head  pulling it down with an overwhelming sense of satisfaction.  It fit. ⁣
Did wearing that dress make me a kinder  more thoughtful   loving friend/sister/daughter  No. ⁣
All it gave me was a short term feeling of pride   a superficial layer of confidence.⁣
⁣
The last 9 months have given me more pleasure   fulfilment than anything I’ve ever experienced. I’ve never felt so scrumdidddddlyumcious. It’s also shown me just how far I’ve come in the last 4 years.⁣

1030,chessieking,influencers,"3 things that were unknown to me about HG pre-pregnancy ⁣
⁣
ask Mat what hyperemesis gravidarum is   he will tell you ‘it’s like watching a video of your worst  most crushing   debilitating hangover  over   over again 23 000 times for 20 wks straight... then imagine having to pick it all up with a doggy bag’⁣
⁣
I’ve spent a big chunk of my pregnancy in hospital but last week I had an extended sleepover after 11 wks of pretty intense rib pain. Turns out  I’ve torn an intercostal muscle   potentially fractured a rib from the relentless sickness. Something I didn’t even think was possible ⁣
⁣
if you are being held hostage by HG  firstly I want to give you the gentlest squeeze   hold your hair back whilst you’re in your chosen-sick-space. I really hope these 3 things help you through or give you ways to support a partner/friend suffering ⁣
⁣
1. 28 wks deep   I could open a pharmacy with the sheer volume of medication I’ve been prescribed. Most of the pills haven’t even made it down to do their job BUT if you can get the melt-on-the-tongue tablets they are honestly life changing. I’m on a 6-day-no-sick-streak since getting them.
⁣
2. You know your body better than anyone else in the universe but when it’s all new  you don’t know whether being sick 20x in a day is ‘normal’. I left it ‘dangerously late’ when I was first admitted to hospital at 10 wks  the first time I’d ever been to A E  the tiny bit of wee sample I could get out was like beer   I hadn’t kept a bite of food down for 28 hrs. It’s the last thing you’ll be thinking of doing but keep a tally of how many times you’ve been sick - when you pass the 7/8 mark  get to hospital hooked up to a big pillow of liquids.
⁣
3. Find someone you feel safe to speak to about how you’re feeling  whether that’s a midwife  a friend or a support group online.⁣
There’s a tidal wave of emotions every time I’m sick   initially a heavy sense of guilt at the start  for causing the tiny little human inside of me distress... but after being reassured by her power kicks  I am just so in awe of my body for protecting her in her little cocoon. Every time I leave hospital I feel a tsunami of relief   a flood of even more love for her"

⁣
here are 3 things that aren’t going to be extraordinarily life-changing but will hopefully help them find solace in amongst the dizzying unknown space they’re currently floating in⁣
⁣
1. “we’re still in the midst of a global pandemic  moving a wedding day back is really not the worst thing going on right now”⁣
I may be wrong but there’s a strong possibility they already know that   have been thinking the same thing for a big chunk of the year⁣
⁣
listening is your gift to the couple - you could set up a facetime  order them some paints   get them to splatter their brain on a canvas... you can be a pair of ears whilst they’re trying to unravel the cocktail of emotions they’re feeling right now ⁣
⁣
⁣
2. “if it was me I’d just get married   have the extravaganza next year” ⁣
that was my first reaction when we spoke about rearranging ours  it was meant to be July  then it was scooted to next may   now we just don’t know...⁣
I promise you there will have probably been endless conversations between the couple juggling between doing it now or waiting  respect their decision   celebrate whatever they choose to do. A simple “you’re making the best decision  we’ll be there whenever it happens”⁣ would be wonderful
⁣
⁣
3. your friend may not have a new date locked in but you can use this extra time to make things for the wedding together. Save some money for the couple   maybe suggest learning calligraphy so you can both create name place cards or new invites.⁣
If that’s absolutely not your thing  you could very kindly offer your tastebuds to test out a selection of new wine options - sacrificing your fresh mornings for the couple so they don’t have to experience the hangovers  a selfless act⁣

on July 14th  instead of walking down the aisle on what was supposed to be our wedding day I was walking into surgery to have a LINQ device fitted. It’s basically a mini USB stick that is slotted under the skin near the heart   it records your heart rate 24/7 for up to 3 years. This was to give my cardiologist a better understanding of my condition  SVT  before going up through my groin to burn off any extra electrodes causing the episodes   filling in that hole⁣

It was pressing on a nerve but my cardiologist was convinced a few more days would give my body time to adjust. ⁣

The 8 days after that were unbearable   my body was doing everything it could to reject it. I was taken into emergency surgery to have it removed which wasn’t an easy procedure as it had wiggled itself down. 
I wasn’t allowed anyone with me for any of it because of the situation   I was awake for both operations which left me pretty traumatised

7. It’s not going to be an A-B kinda thing  becoming best friends  you   your body  - it’s going to be more like the entire alphabet  stopping   learning at each letter. Turn the ‘I hate’ into ‘I celebrate’   give more time to being a good human instead of a good looking human⁣

I dare you.
Ask yourself  when did my baby become a threat to you 

When I cried 
When I started to crawl 
When I started to speak 
When I started to dream 
When I laugh with joy 
When I learn to read 
When I played with my toy gun 
When my jeans were too baggy 
When I wore a hoodie 
When I drive a car 
When I protect my family 
When I went for a run 
When I fought for your country 
When I left the grocery store 
When I held my arms   my hands high 
When I finally earned my degree 
When I loved with my heart   soul 
When I sat enjoying my coffee 
When I go for a job interview 
When the dictation of my speech wasn’t like yours 
When I protest for the injustice 
When I wear a mask to protect you   myself 
When I move too fast 

When I breathe 

When I was born 

When did my baby become a threat to you."

Mumma told me my height was elegant   it was a gift to be my height⁣

My brain told me I wanted my legs to look like the girls’ in the magazines⁣
Mumma told me to write down all the things my legs helped me do - I remember listing out dancing  skipping  jumping  cycling  swimming  roller blading
⁣
Mumma   her body spent 9 months creating me. She didn’t bring me into this world for me to speak unkindly to my body or try to change it in every way I could⁣

The ‘Uniquely Me’ toolkit  linked in my stories  has been written by experts - jam packed full of advice  activities   exercises to help you   your children appreciate your bodies together.⁣
⁣
One of the main catalysts for developing my body confidence was giving myself a daily body-ology lesson. Bringing it back to self-appreciation. ⁣
You can do it with me - each day identify 3 body functions   celebrate them.⁣

Every day is as an experiment - finding things that fuel us  accounts on here that empower us.⁣

You know when you’re at the airport check-in and the person asks you  ‘Has anyone packed your bags for you ’ while pointing at a sheet listing dangerous goods.⁣ Well  that’s one way to look at your Instagram feed.

⁣⁣
I wanted to talk about this all week but I felt floppy   deflated. Last Saturday Matchu   I decided to postpone the wedding from July to May next year.⁣⁣
⁣⁣ It took a few days   a lot of tears to process that the countdown has gone from less than 2 months to a year. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
My bestfriends reminded me that I designed my wedding dress on being able to cuddle people. The only thing I said I wanted when I first started looking for dresses is that I wanted it to be ‘huggable’.⁣⁣ Squeezing people is one of my favourite things in the world   we wouldn’t be able to do that right now. Next year those hugs will be evennn tighter.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
I appreciate there’s so much more going on in the world than just weddings being cancelled but I know there are so many of you going through the same process. Since Friday night with the girls  they called it the warm up hen  I have felt full to the brim on love. I have loved speaking to those of you who are in the same boat  it has helped so much   I am bursting with excitement for you all
⁣⁣
Celebrate your original hen date⁣⁣
Celebrate your original wedding date⁣⁣

1319,courtneydblack,influencers,"I see a post the other day by a well known influencer claiming that she was eating a “normal healthy” amount of calories and stated that was “1300 calories”…. This is NOT a normal and healthy amount of calories but I don’t blame her for thinking it is because as women we have been told for so many years that this is enough for us. That we need to eat less. Less is best etc. 

You can’t live your life in such a huge calorie deficit and you also do NOT need to eat such low calories to lose fat. 

What happens when you eat such little calories for a long period of time 

 low energy levels 
 constant thoughts of food 
 low libido 
 mood swings 
 loss of period 
 poor hormone health  hair loss  skin problems etc  

Our bodies are not made to function in a constant deficit… most of our lives we should spend eating in maintenance calories. The correct approach to fat loss is sustainable and slow  

When we eat such little calories for a long period of time our body adapts to those calories and they become the new maintenance. So what happens is we need to eat less and less calories in order to be in a deficit and lose fat. 

So what do we do  We need to get you eating MORE calories daily so that when you do enter a fat loss phase you’ll be dieting on more calories than <1200.

Increasing your calories slowly  10   at a time will increase the amount of calories you can eat while remaining lean  slow and steady wins the race  fat loss will be minimal and the results will be so incredible because you will be eating more  sleeping better  training way better  because more energy therefore burning more in your sessions  etc  

Please don’t be scared of increasing your calories from under eating  in the long run it’s so worth it. Having food freedom  having more energy  balancing your hormones etc  

Please listen to coach CB  "

Eating a surplus of calories for a period of time is the only way that you are going to gain weight  not by eating later in the day.

When I had my eating disorder it was one of my “food rules” that I had to stop eating at 4pm… I also believed drinking a cup of green tea 10 times a day would help me lose fat… this is NOT true. If you eat 1800 calories between 8am-4pm or between 8am-8pm it makes absolutely no difference to your weight.

Comparison is the thief of joy and we can’t forget that social media just a hi light of someone’s life

I severely compared myself a few years ago which made me so miserable and constantly chasing perfection. I wouldn’t walk out the house without feeling uncomfortable in my own skin.

You also shouldn’t feel pressured to drink more just because your friends might be and it’s okay to say “I want to train” just as much as it’s okay to allow yourself a night off  

Having a drink is fine and so is saying your going out but sticking to the non alcoholic drinks

Getting in late is fine but so is having an early night 

This summer is all about balance "
1330,courtneydblack,influencers,"“I’m eating 1200 calories a day and working out every day and not losing weight”… truthfully this is probably why your not losing weight and tbh most of the time your not actually eating 1200 calories per day when you take the week into consideration.

Eating really low calories like 1200 calories a day is not sustainable and what happens is when the weekend comes round all those foods you have avoided and extra energy you have deprived yourself of comes creeping around and it becomes impossible to fight those cravings… so you binge. 

Then Monday comes around and the guilt kicks in and so does the restriction again   

What you need to do  Increase your calories in the week so you can have foods you enjoy in your daily diet curbing all your cravings and will stop you bingeing. 

Let’s work this out … 

Monday - Thursday 1200 calories and then Friday having 2000  Saturday having 3500 Sunday having 3000  this is very very possible and also a very common occurrence with eating out  a few drinks  maybe a Turkish takeaway etc. not to mention it would be more if you had a binge on chocolate  sweets etc     13 300 calories 

Or…

1700 calories Monday - Friday  2300 Saturday  1800 Sunday   12700 calories 

That’s nearly 1k calories less each week… and that right there is how you maintain fat loss 

Or 1900 calories Monday- Sunday   13300 and feeling way less sluggish during the week  eating more daily  sleeping better and performing better in your sessions "

1332,courtneydblack,influencers,"I always forget how far I have come but it’s so important to remember and remind others who might be in the same situation that there is hope of changing your relationship with your body  with your relationship with food and having freedom in your life. 

You don’t have to earn the food you eat… you don’t have to run the calories off  exercise for hours a day or not eat for the rest of the day. You don’t need to earn food. You deserve to enjoy food  to enjoy gatherings and to enjoy your life. 

My eating disorder completely consumed me and my mission as a trainer is to help people never feel how I did. Never feel the need to exercise off any calories  eat dangerously low calories or even go as far as I did to developing chewing and spitting disorder. 

Chewing and spitting is something so common but something so many are scared to discuss because they find it embarrassing and feel they are the only person suffering. You are not alone. I am here to tell you to not be embarrassed. You can get out of this constant worry of food. 

Restrictive dieting leads to many disordered eating traits  focus in allowing yourself food you enjoy  food your body craves

1341,courtneydblack,influencers,"This is something that used to happen to me ALL the time when I tried to eat 1200 calories per day thinking it was the only way to lose fat  This is such a common perception with most women. You need to set yourself up for successful and long term fat loss and cutting your calories this low is not the right way about it  

Such low calories for a low period of time will lead to huge binges and in the long run putting you in a calorie surplus… this will lead you to not losing any fat and actually feeling worse… sluggish  constant cravings etc 

You might be “eating clean” training super hard and always being in a “deficit” but eating too little calories for too long can decrease the amount of movement you do  because you have less energy   reduce your performance when training  less energy    increase cravings and binges. Constantly thinking about food because your DEPRIVED of it and then 1 sweet turns into 30 etc.

Allowing yourself more calories through the day will then stop you going mad on weekends and will leave you feeling a lot calmer on your approach to fat loss. 

Reduce your calories slowly rather than all at once and look at fat loss as sustainable and over time rather than quick… losing loads of weight super quick might sound great but realistically your not going to keep it off. 

Train hard and add resistance training to gain lean muscle mass 
work hard consistently 
Hit steps to increase your NEAT 
Don’t drop your calories too low too quick 
Still include foods you enjoy into your diet"

Feeling super excited  empowered  stressed but proud  overwhelmed but also managing to be chilled in stressful situations. It’s been hectic to say the least. 

I find it quite hard being responsible for so much at a young age and I sometimes have to talk to myself and remind myself it’s okay to be confused and not have all the answers. In business your always going to face things your not sure on  challenges your not sure how to over come and stressful periods. 

I’m so excited about this journey I am on but it’s also never plain sailing. Building a business  brand and even being passionate about something doesn’t come easy.

1350,courtneydblack,influencers,"You’ll be surprised when I say on the left I was eating way less calories  training way more and my diet was way stricter than it is now… I remember this holiday with mum on the left and I was training morning and evening before dinner  was trying to find healthier restaurants  wasn’t drinking to reduce calories etc but I could never get my body how I wanted it to be. On top of this  I had also lost my period again. I got so aggravated as to why my stomach wasn’t losing fat I even enquired into lipo suction  at the age of 22 . 

I was massively over training and under eating which was putting my body under so much stress. I was also bingeing on weekends massively because I was SO strict in the week… so even though I thought I was in a deficit I was probably going way over into a surplus from the weekends. 

Your body NEEDS rest days. On the left I was spending hours in the gym now I spend 45 minutes at HOME following  courtneyblackapp real time workouts and I have seen better results than ever  feeling fitter  stronger and happier. 

FUEL your body   You probably need way more calories than you think you do. I’ve learned so much about my body over time. How much it needs  how much I need to rest and how stress really effects your body  your sleep  your results. 

Reverse dieting involves slowly increasing your calories to a level which is healthy and sustainable… it leads to an improved mental and physical state. Of course you will gain some fat while your body adapts but slowly increasing the calories means you will minimise fat gains while gaining lean muscle.

Escaping from an extreme calorie restriction and constant yo-yo dieting… do you find that if you have a day off or a weekend away you automatically gain weight 

You need to up your calories/reverse diet if 
you’ve ignored any advice and way undercut your calories
you’ve been eating way too little calories and have plateaued
your underrating for the amount of training your doing"

1362,courtneydblack,influencers,"It’s not the situation  it’s how you handle it… if I’m completely honest with you I’ve had a really stressful and chaotic couple of days due to work. I used to be so reactive in these sorts of situations and would normally deal with them terribly… normally by making rash decisions and not listening to anyones advice. 

I used to really struggle with taking constructive criticism and would always think I was right. This is a really poor way to handle situations and normally ends up making them a lot worse. It’s so important to be calm in situations even when it’s hard to and always ask for help when you need it. You can’t be good at everything you do and sometimes asking for help is the most effective way to get things done. 

I’m so proud of how I have learned to deal with situations and I’ve matured so much over the last 2-3 years. Seeing how far I am progressing as a business woman makes me super proud and I sometimes forget that. 

It’s so important to take a step away when things are all coming on top and try think in a calm and structured manner  even though this can sometimes be so difficult .

You can’t expect others to understand how your feeling  those are YOUR thoughts  YOUR emotions. Allow yourself to process and deal with your emotions rather than always trying to be positive and happy. It’s okay to have days where you are extra stressed or run down. It makes you human "

 Eat foods that make me feel good and also full. I aim to eat a high fibre and high protein diet. This doesn’t mean every meal has to be this way. Sometimes lunch is high fibre then I may have a pasta etc for dinner. I just aim to get a lot of veggies in to my meals. 
 I still eat ALL carbs- bread  pasta etc is NOT bad. There is no such thing as a “bad carb” for sure they may be higher in calories but that’s fine… 
I try keep my foods as varied as possible and try not to eat the same meal repeatedly
I love experimenting with food- my top tip is to get a range of different herbs and spices. It makes creating tasty dishes way easier "

The first collection I initially designed around colours of the earth- sand  trees  fire  ice etc and I really wanted neutral and beautiful tones to suit every skin tone. I wanted gold accents to add a feel of luxury. I designed these items so every woman can feel confident  comfortable and empowered when working out  lounging or looking stylish. 

The fabric is buttery soft and super comfortable but also durable so it’s perfect for my hardcore workouts  yoga or just relaxing…. You won’t want to take it off. All the items are completely squat proof and workout tested. 

As the brand evolves  my mission is to introduce even more styles  high impact bras  lounge wear  colours and more. It’s just going to keep on evolving and I am so excited for the process  for now… here is my first ever collection  drawn by hand and designed by me. Tried and tested by me and many other women.

1374,courtneydblack,influencers,"I’ve changed so much over the last 3 years and I’ve become Courtney again… I completely lost myself and I was completely hiding behind a mask of makeup  lashes  fillers to try find perfection. I was so unhappy within myself and was searching for validation on so many different levels which would drag me down daily. I walked out the door every day worried what people thought when they looked at me. My head would be down and I would feel uncomfortable. If you see me walking down the street now  I walk with confidence and ease and that’s so genuine. I walk down the street with the biggest smile on my face and the first thing I notice about anyone else is their smile  attitude and how they hold them self… rather than being so judgmental of others. 

I feel the most judgmental people are the most insecure and unhappy and I know this first hand. 

I was constantly comparing myself to people  never a minute went by that I didn’t put myself down about something and it led me to completely loosing myself. I am nothing like the girl on the left  I had completely lost my personality. I was acting like someone I was not to mask the sadness. Back then I would never of posted the videos I do now  sweat in my eyes  rolling about and falling on the floor but it’s ME AND I LOVE THAT I SHARE IT  I share 100  of me now and it makes me so happy every day.

1378,courtneydblack,influencers,"I spoke on my stories yesterday about worrying about losing progress over Easter weekend due to the lack of movement and increased calories. Just to drum it into you  you will NOT lose all your progress from one weekend of over indulging… it takes around 7k calories to gain just 1lb body fat so you would need to constantly be over eating to gain a load of weight so please do not panic  restrict  you DO NOT need to drink lemon water or a green juice  get a workout in  eat good balanced meals and you’ll be back on track.

Week 2 of my mini cut and I feel amazing. The main thing you need to focus on when going into a deficit is to make it enjoyable and not fall into the dieting fads there are… no carb  boring foods  intermittent fasting etc and eat foods you actually enjoy.

I’ve come over so many challenges while creating this brand with the fabric  so many rounds of samples  different factories  delivery  packaging  stitching  names  colours to suit skin tones etc and it’s been such a stressful journey.

I DO NOT OWN THE RIGHTS TO THIS MUSIC"
1400,courtneydblack,influencers,"Not everyone is going to like you… being in this industry has taught me a lot. Mainly that some people simply just will not like you… with no real reason why. Last year I found it really hard to get my head around people were so critical of small things I did… even down to what hairbands I would wear in my workouts. This lead me to seeing a therapist as I would get so overwhelmed. 

Truth is  with something as personal as exercise there will be ALOT of mixed opinions on me. That’s completely fine because how someone else is feeling is not how I am feeling. Their emotions are not mine and neither are their opinions. I have learnt to love everything I do and believe in my work so much that you kind of have to take these opinions on the chin because you literally cannot please everyone. I say personal because exercise is therapy… so many people use it as an escape so I completely understand why.

Being so open to criticism can sometimes be so hard but the truth is… I know I’m one of the best trainers. I have motivated and helped and continue to help so many become happier and fitter every day. It’s okay for people not to like me  my training style  my outfits whatever they want to not like. That’s not for me to try and change or worry about. 

We all need to learn that as a human not everyone is going to like us. That’s okay  "

Every food should be eating in moderation and with enjoyment   cutting carbs is also going to make you super low in energy  mood and therefore stress will increase  sleep will be worse  mood swings etc  Not to mention less energy for your workouts "

1423,courtneydblack,influencers,"“How did you get into fitness ” - well firstly I got into fitness for all the wrong reasons. I would train to burn as many calories as possible  I only ever done long cardio sessions and I would eat as little as possible to try lose as much weight as possible. 

My body went into over drive  didn’t have a period for nearly 3 years and I constantly lacked energy  always tired  never happy  always miserable  and my hormones were all over the place  my skin broke out constantly  I was emotional and moody  and this was ALL due to my poor relationship with food. 

I also had severe body dysmorphia.. constantly prodding and poking my body  calling myself “fat” or “puffy” and I always put myself down for how I looked. I believed I wasn’t good enough  slim enough or athletic enough and it had serious impacts on my health. 

I would avoid foods I loved  thought I had to cut carbs and food groups to get result and I constantly just dreamed about all the food I wanted. I suffered with chewing and spitting disease  chewing chocolate etc up and then spitting it out  to try avoid calories which lead to serious health damages and I was the lowest I have ever been. 

Now… I’m into fitness because it makes me feel STRONG and EMPOWERED. It makes me feel like a strong woman and every day I wake up feeling healthy.

I enjoy foods because they taste good  make me feel great and fuel my body  

I don’t constantly think about food and I follow a diet with no restrictions and a healthy and balanced lifestyle. 

Fitness for me is my passion. It makes me feel alive… it doesn’t control my life  "

You will leave this challenge feeling so much fitter than the day you started it with way more education under your belt from the best coaches in the industry.

1430,courtneydblack,influencers,"For so many years I would try find foods that I needed to eliminate from my diet to lose fat or to get in  the best shape… I was searching for an answer that doesn’t exist because there is NO foods that are bad or will stop you getting into shape. The only way you will gain fat is if you eat over your maintenance calories every day which will put you into a weight gain phase… 

Allowing foods you enjoy into your diet will not stop you seeing results. 

Cutting carbs is not superior for fat loss

Never eating out will not speed up your fat loss journey 

Restricting yourself will just cause you to over think your diet  constantly think of food  maybe quit easier  because you feel like it’s not sustainable  and will cause food to control your life. 

Let me tell you… you can still get results and include your favourite foods into your diet  enjoy nights out with your friends  enjoy meals off plan and you can still enjoy life

Trust in me as your trainer when I say  I have been there. I have had such a mental battle with food my entire life and I have come our stronger and healthier. I know exactly how you are feeling. I know how lonely it can be.

I pushed away loved ones for so many years because I struggled so much with low energy and didn’t know how to cope with the fact I was always thinking about food. How I could eat less food  how to deal with dinners and social gatherings  how to react when someone bought me some chocolate as a nice gesture. 

You do not need to eat low calories to get results. Your body literally NEEDS food and NEEDS rest days

Carbohydrates do NOT make you fat 

You do NOT need to stop eating after a certain time.

You do NOT need to cut food groups. 

You do NOT need to eat before dinner out. You are allowed nights off your plan "

1456,courtneydblack,influencers,"Just a 25 year old girl with dreams bigger than you can imagine  every day I feel so proud of  courtneyblackapp and everything it has achieved. To help tens of thousands change their lives and become happier makes me so proud. 

Every day I wake up with a purpose. Every day I wake up knowing what  courtneyblackapp does helps so many people and that’s what gets me going. 

I started this dream in my flat with 0 staff  met my developer in a coffee shop and now have a team of 7 and growing  huge campaigns running  tens of thousands of lives changed and even more to come. 

This is just the start "
1457,courtneydblack,influencers,"“It’s easy for you”… let me tell you something… this hasn’t come easy or naturally for me. I’ve had so many ups and downs on my fitness journey. I don’t have “a fast metabolism” or a “naturally athletic build” and I certainly haven’t found my fitness journey easy. Fitness has transformed my life and it’s made me the best version of me. It’s not been easy but it’s most definitely been worth it. 

I still haven’t quite pinpointed where my disordered eating has come from. I’m starting to learn a bit more but I can’t quite say exactly. It happened around the time my mum and dad split up and I stopped Latin dancing. I was always fed super well as a kid and my dad loved anything sweet so was around chocolates and sweets a lot. Maybe when he was removed from my life I felt the need to do that with anything sweet  Who knows  I’m still in the making of quite working that out but it’s a good starting point.

If your struggling with your relationship with food  ask yourself… what was your relationship with food growing up  What was meal times like  How was food spoken about in your family  

It’s hard to know why we have a poor relationship with food. Why we yo-yo diet. Why we feel the need to restrict.

I had terrible body image for most of my young adult life and that’s only changed very recently. I then fell into a trap of wanting to impress everyone else and seeing my body/ image as the only thing that I had that was good. I absolutely hated myself in the second image but I felt like I constantly needed to prove something.

I am now the happiest in my body I have ever been and that’s because I don’t restrict foods  I enjoy myself  I love my training and I have accepted I will never be perfect and that’s absolutely fine because to me  I am perfect and that’s because I am happy and healthy "

1466,courtneydblack,influencers,"Maintenance calories are SO under rated  I feel so many people focus on a fat loss goal and are constantly striving to eat in a deficit when they would hit their goal of “toning up” and gaining lean muscle way better eating in maintenance calories  

You cannot forever be in a calorie deficit as your body will soon adapt to those calories  making them your new “normal” / calories you need to maintain that shape. 

I start a fat loss phase before a huge event/ holiday or simply if I just want to hit a goal. Now if you have weight you want to loose  a calorie deficit is most definitely for you. However  if your looking to build your physique  gain lean muscle and improve your shape then maintenance calories  resistance training and cardio for your heart health is most definitely the way forward  

For me  maintenance is around 2k calories training 5 days per week. 

I am currently filming 4 days per week for the app so those sessions are 45 minute workouts  the real time workouts I post  and then I am following the app gym workout plan 1 day per week and training a leg day.

When eating in a deficit you will still want to have snacks that you enjoy and this is an easy way to fit those into your macros. It’s also completely fine to have full sugar ben and jerries  chocolate etc but you will just have to portion control and fit them into your diet so you can keep within your calories to stick to your goal. 

Life is all about balance and moderation  

Let me know if these snack hacks helped you "
1475,courtneydblack,influencers,"I don’t even recognise the girl I was 3 years ago… I was such a different person and a completely lost soul. I think it’s clear from the pictures and videos in this post the sadness in my eyes. This year was the worst year for me mentally and I didn’t even realise how bad it got while it was happening. It’s only now that I am happy and have come so far mentally that I realise how much I have changed.

I looked for love from other people  the wrong people  which lead to me feeling even worse. I remember seeing someone at this time and it completely ruined my confidence. I didn’t have any self love so I craved attention and love from other people I would bend over backwards for people and forget my own boundaries and self respect.

I ended up going out a lot  I even ended up taking drugs. Nearly every weekend. I remember being in Ibiza and to be honest I was a complete loose cannon. It’s not something I am proud of but I was out nearly every weekend and would use it as an escape. I followed the crowd and just wanted to be liked. I took it way too far which made me feel terrible and I wasn’t being myself at all. I have nothing against people having fun btw but I used this as a copying mechanism and it ended up leaving me in a bad situation. 

I cried all the time to a point where it was normal for me to cry every morning when I looked in the mirror and every time I went to bed. I restricted my food to have some sort of control and made myself so focused on food and not eating and over training. You can see here I ate egg whites  wouldn’t allow myself seasoning  sauces etc and I lost my period due to this and had very temperamental hormones.

I worked long hours but didn’t give any quality to that work because I was so empty inside. I just wanted to go home and curl into a ball. I can say now I am such a strong and powerful woman  honestly not much can bring me down because I know how worthy I AM. I don’t associate with people who make me feel worthless and I know my self worth and I love myself. Self love is the biggest power you can have. This has helped me succeed as a business woman  boss and the happiest version of me."

1480,courtneydblack,influencers,"From having an eating disorder and a terrible relationship with food to being strong  healthy  gaining muscle  loving food and eating without guilt and helping thousands reach their fitness goal.

I remember once being on the train and a group of young boys laughing at how skinny I was  they even shouted about my bum as I got off the train. For me  I didn’t take this as offensive… in fact I actually was thrilled to be called thin as that was my only goal at the time. Everything I did was to get to my goal of being as thin as possible. 

I would chronically under eat and seriously over train. I would run for hours every day and I even remember getting to the gym near my work once at 4am because I couldn’t sleep and wanted to get as many hours in as possible. I remember it being a 24 hour gym and being the only person there. 

I was so obsessed with the gym I would get the night bus and sometimes even walk at 4/5am to get extra exercise in… looking back now I can’t believe I put myself at danger like this just to get extra exercise in. 

Let me tell you something. You do not need to under eat  restrict foods  cut food groups  train for hours and stop living your life to see results. 

I am in the best shape I have ever been in and also the happiest and fittest I have ever been and I train less and eat way more and more importantly a way bigger variety of foods than ever before. 

Please do not cut food groups. 

Do not follow crash diets

We make decisions every day. To workout or to not  to eat junk or to fuel our bodies. We have to make decisions and then they create outcomes. 

Some days your not going to be motivated  some days your not going to want to go for the walk. Exercising has SO many benefits for your mental health  physical health and of course will improve your physique. You have to push yourself outside your comfort zone and train even when you do not feel that motivated. 

If you rely on motivation your probably not going to get the results you want or do as much as you probably should. You’ll probably chose the easy option. 

You are grown up enough to make your own choices even though they may not be the most attractive option

MYTH BUSTER  you have to consume protein 30-60 minutes post workout or else your muscles for max. For a regular person  resistance exercise and consuming sufficient protein is more important than the timing of consuming it  

In short  it’s just important that you’re hitting your daily protein macros  the gains will follow. 

The vegan protein is all packed full of B vitamins  10g of protein per serving  low calorie  made from real fruit- orange and mango  causes 0 bloating and is delicious

I have visited once before and loved it then too  After this trip  I am in a rush to go back ASAP  We were only there for five days  I would definitely spend more time in Lisbon and instead stay in a Airbnb/villa in Vilamoura. 

There is SO much to do in Lisbon it was impossible to do it in a few days. We predominantly went to cheer Ethan on in an Iron Man challenge. I had to mute the video of him coming through the finish line because wow  nobody needs to hear that. No wonder people were looking at me funny.

THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO JOIN THE 28 DAY SHRED   LINK IN BIO

Here’s a picture of me a few weeks ago vs me in 2016. I was travelling when the left picture was taken  working in a hostel  eating food from the hostel which I got instead of actually being paid  and drinking alcohol from buckets whilst I was also “working” trying to get people to come into the hostel to also drink from buckets . It was the best time of my life but boy I was unhealthy by the end.

I came home shortly afterwards and went back to working in a burger restaurant  I had worked there for years before whilst I was auditioning   and decided I had to make a change as I was miserable and unhealthy  so I decided to do my PT course. It was the best decision I ever made. It changed my life  I shortly left my waitressing job and was teaching at some of the best studios in London.
Of course it was great seeing my body change and the Chang beer disappearing from my belly but you know what the best thing about teaching/training was  The clients  Seeing the change in peoples confidence  being part of someone’s journey  was and IS still what gives me a fire in my belly every day 

I miss teaching classes in a studio but I’m so grateful I still do what I love but in a different way  Maybe one day I could open a studio of my own  

Anyway  here’s just a few testimonials from current members of Shape Up. Some have been with me from the beginning and some have only just begun their Shape Up journey. I can’t wait for what I have planned for the future of Shape Up and I hope I get to reach many more people and be a part of their journey too 

I am so proud and grateful for every person that is on Shape up or has passed through.

S has done a few groups with me now and I’m so proud of her achievements. She started by doing the live workouts and long walks with her lovely pup  and of course overtime has built up her stamina so now she is adding in extra workouts that are saved to the group. 

She is getting stronger and fitter by the day. She made a Choice to join a SHAPE UP group and therefore landed a lifestyle change which is only going to keep getting better and better. 

Most importantly  as you can see from her testimonials  these groups are improving her confidence and is benefiting her mental health too 

S thanks me all the time  but this progress is all down to her. She is the one who dragged her ass to the mat  she is the one who made better food choices. She is the one who COMMITTED AND STUCK TO IT. 

This feedback alongside  lots of others  is what my life is about. I literally live to workout with you lot  and when we have successful stories like this  I want to shout it from the roof tops  It can be done  you just have to WANT IT. S’s proof is how much she wants it.

28 DAY SUMMER SHRED COOMIN IN HOT. SIGN UP DATE OPENS ON GOOD FRIDAY.. whos in

HIT THE WHOLE UPPER BODY WITH THIS AMAZING  TIME EFFICIENT SESH.

Here’s the workout 

 PULL UPS- assisted or unassisted. I’m just showing off in this video cause I can now do 3/4 without help  then I add the lever to get the full set. 
4-5 x 8-10.
 SEATED DUMBBELL OVERHEAD PRESS 3-4 x 10-12
SUPERSET WITH BARBELL BEHIND THE HEAD MILITARY PRESS. 
3-4 x 8-10
 UNDER HAND GRIP BARBELL BENT OVER ROW. 3-4 x 10-12
SUPERSET WITH DUMBBELL RENEGADE ROW 3-4 x 10. Forgot to film sorry 
 PULL DOWNS 3-4 x 8-10. 
SEATED ROW 3-4 x 8-10
CABLE LAT RAISE. 3 x 10-12 each side.

The reps are guidelines to how many you should be hitting per set  of course  it depends on how heavy your weights are. E.G. If the range is 8-10  I’m suggesting your should be at or leaning towards failure at 8… 
The sets are guidelines too. If you’re lacking time stick to the 3 but if you have the time aim for the forth and it should be struggle city .

What I remind myself 

CONSISTENCY. Hold yourself accountable.
DISCIPLINE. Do it even when you don’t want to.
PATIENCE. Your hard work will pay off. 

THE WORKOUT  

SQUAT. 3-4x 10-12. Progressive overloading over the sets.. this was my last set/ struggle city so I’m a bit all over the gaff 
SPLIT SQUAT ELEVATED FRONT FOOT. 3-4X 10-12. It’s a myth to not let your knee come over your foot. Just please ensure it’s heading in the same direction as the foot and you have a lovely wide stance to ensure more stability. This exercise is focusing on the front quad obv still engage glutes  
 LEG PRESS 3-4x10. Tempo 2111. Slow and low baby… 
Super set with BODY WEIGHT SQUAT PULSE 30 secs
 SL HAMSTRING CURL 3-4X10-12. 
Little insight for ya.. Personal pet hate is this exercise but WE DO IT ANYWAY  
WALKING LUNGES. 3X20

I often get asked how I stay motivated all the time  and the truth is I don’t. Nobody can be 100  motivated ALL of the time k  anyone that tells you different is lying to your face . But it’s about being discipline even when you really cba  YOU are in control. 

1. JUST START. If you’re putting off exercising or buying the healthy food because you don’t know where to start then  in short  JUST START. It might be a long journey ahead but it’s only going to take longer the longer you put it off. 
2. SET REALISTIC GOALS. Vision what you see for yourself long term and short term. Be honest with yourself about what is doable and give yourself enough time to do it.
3. BE PATIENT. Changes aren’t going to happen overnight. Safe and sustainable habits are built over time.
4. BE CONSISTENT. This is when the changes will happen  you MUST be disciplined and dedicated to the cause. Make sure you really are putting your ALL into these lifestyle changes.
5. BE KIND TO YOURSELF. Don’t beat yourself up if you’re progress isn’t moving as quick as you’d like. If you are doing your BEST then that’s enough

CLICK SAVE AND LETS GET STRONG AF   

My split for next 6 weeks is  1x BACK AND BIS  1x SHOULDERS AND TRIS  1x QUADS AND HAMMIES  1x GLUTES    4 live home workouts with my Shape Up Group   

Most exercises will use all your muscles in your lower body obviously  as they work is opposition to keep you standing up  buttttt I want to sculpt my booty  who doesn’t  but I also want more quad   So I’m splitting them up and spending more time isolating each muscle group more. 

Here’s this session 
1. BOX STEP UPS SINGLE LEG DEAD LIFT TO STEP OFF. 3x12 each leg 
Try challenge yourself and keep most weight in the leg stepping up so when you’re up there  your core stability is working like hell  I suggest some core activation before the sesh 
2. HEEL ELEVATED FRONT SQUAT 4x10. 
Bloody quadding hell. Make sure you practice your form before adding weight. Lift those elbows  keep chest lifted. 
3. BOX SINGLE LEG SIT 3x10 each leg. 
Hello hamstrings  nice to see you again. Ensure your full weight has sat before you drive up through the standing heel to standing. Keep your lifted leg off the floor  use your CORE  
4. PAUSED RDL 4x10. 
I’m sorry for this one  but there really is nothing better for your hammies than this exercise. The pause is just me being mean to take your momentum out of it and put extra bita tension on your hamstrings.
5. HACK SQUAT 4x10  if you can  cause I was in struggle city by then . 

Let me know if this tickles your fancy   ENJOY  

 shapeupwithgabbyallen"
1752,gabbydawnallen,influencers,"  GLUTE ACTIVATION   SAVE ME IM A GAME CHANGER   

Do you know how often I am told “I can’t feel it in my bum  it’s all in my quads”.. OFTEN. This is usually because a lot of us are quad dominant.  Which is interesting as our glute max are actually the largest muscles in the body but we are often sat on them 

So  if this is you and you are trying to grow your butt cheeks but need to relieve the legs a little  incorporate some glute activation exercises into your next lower body/leg day and fire those babies up to activate and engage them first so they’re likely to work harder during your session. 

I would also suggest doing one all round lower body focus session a week and one session dedicated solely to your booty   

Of course  it can be down to other factors too- is your weight in the right place or are too far forward on your feet placing the bias on your quads  Is your back straight  chest lifted and your core braced in your squat  Are your knees in line with your toes  not swinging in or out  
With every exercise you do  you should have a mental checklist to tick off to execute it correctly and safely. 
It will become second nature eventually but it’s always good to revisit our form every now and again to prevent injury and therefore longevity of our training.

A few staple pieces in todays session because guess what  they bloody work . My legs did not work by the end of this.

 RDL - 3-4 sets 8-12 reps. This should be HARD. You should be aiming for failure of the last rep of last couple of sets. You might need to do some wrist/forearm strengthening to up your weight here. 
 BARBELL CURTSY IN PLACE- I did a pyramid here. 
12 reps enough weight to feel it but at around 7/10 effort > 
10 reps up your weight effort level 8/10
8 reps up your weight effort level 9-10/10
  back down dropping weight 
 SINGLE LEG PRESS - 4 x10 each side tempo 2010  2 down 1 up 
 SEATED LEG CURL - 3 x 10. Slow these down if you can 
 LEG EXTENSION- 3 x 10.  And slow these down too 

Progressive overloads is the best sustainable way to do this- gradually adding weight over time  you’ll keep your muscles challenged and you’ll get stronger.

Safety is 1st priority of course but you MUST be lifting heavy enough to reach failure in order to get stronger   build muscle.

I LOOOVE training back  Back gains are 
Here’s the last back sesh I did  

• assisted pull ups. Focus on eccentric contraction to build that strength to get to unassisted 4 x10
• seated cable high wide grip row 
4 x 10
• single arm high wide pull 
3 x 10 each side
• seated narrow grip row 
4 x10
• bent over straight arm lat pull down 4x 10 
• seated single arm narrow row 3x10 each side 

Challenge yourself with the weight and aim for 10 reps every set  if you can easily do it  add a little more but remember /
• Control is KEY when it comes to recruiting those muscles.. 
• pause for a split second at the top of each rep for that extra squeeze
•   slow it down then see if it’s still easy  
• if you can rep out to failure at end of final set  be my guest

1810,gabbydawnallen,influencers,"When I was younger I was embarrassed of my scoliosis scars and would do everything I could to hide them  I felt it made me ugly and more annoyingly I felt it became a hindrance to my performing career I had set my heart on.  Now  16 years on from the initial operation I believe my operation and setbacks are what made me who I am today and why I am where I am today. 

I still went on to be a professional dancer  become a fitness instructor and then I was cast on Love Island  I honestly don t believe any of that stuff would have happened if i hadn t pushed and pushed myself to not let my disability define me. 

I now wear my scars with pride and I am delighted to tell my story when people ask how I got the 18 inch scar down my back. My scars are my story. I look after my scars like I do with my skin care routine. If my scars are going to tell a story  they need to look good  I use  nutureskin products to nourish and moisturize them. I need my scars to be as supple and soft as possible to support my active life and I now RELY on Nuture to do this for me.  The skin treatment oil is multi-functional  like me   I also use the godley oil on my stretch marks on my booty for all my gains that I work for  You can get your hands on it at Boots ad"
1811,gabbydawnallen,influencers,"BTS  

You wouldn’t think I hate modelling would ya  In this social media world we live in  it’s hard to not compare yourself to others. I am short for starters  shorter than I should’ve been if I hadn’t suffered scoliosis    in the past I have been trolled for my body type and therefore my confidence had been knocked. Try as you might to ignore it  it settles somewhere in your subconscious anyway.

I have been grafting to get to this point in myself  I am more body confident than I have been but I have also been more consistent with my training with my Shape Up plans  training myself at the gym and focusing on my nutrition. I am not yet where I want to be entirely but I am certainly confident to sit in barely nothing and pose as you can see so I’m obviously moving in the right direction  

I’m setting goals for next year and I’m excited to keep the momentum going  Here’s to taking this confidence into 2022   Who’s with me  "

1825,gabbydawnallen,influencers,"  WHAT I EAT IN A DAY WHEN AWAY    
Of course my nutrition and my training has to adapt when I go away for work or play but I just know from experience that I feel so much better in myself if I try and keep on top of them both as best as I can.

This is absolutely not me saying you can’t rest  relax and indulge when you’re away  of course you can  you SHOULD  I’m sure you saw the daily iced cream take I had in Ibiza this summer.   once a hangover hit  that’s it  the training goes in the bin cause I’m old and can’t hack my drink anymore . This trip was a work based one so I wasn’t drinking alcohol  apart from a couple of Proseccos on last night  so I found it easier to stay motivated and on top of things. 

I’m sure it’s a common theme with most people that as soon as alcohol gets involved  your decision making changes re food  exercise and everything else 

I was taking my Shape Up 10 sessions out there as well as training myself and working with B so my days were pretty jam packed  

Here’s an example of what I was doing 

BREAKFAST  Buffet porridge with raspberry compote   bowl of fruit that I pop in my bag to have over the course of the day  am I chav or do other people do that too  
I also have 2 black coffees every morning.

Then I’d train myself and teach Shape Up class. 

LUNCH   hotel chicken satay   caprese salad. Lemon water and maybe a Diet Coke if I felt like it.

Then we’d travel an hour or two  shoot for campaign and travel back. 

Snack  a protein bar of sorts. I did have one of these ones but didn’t take a photo so I stole this from their page 

DINNER  Gorge Italian restaurant at hotel. Shared starters between 3 - beef carpaccio Baked aubergine thing and bruschetta. I chose Seabass fillet as my main. 

DESSERT  ice cream obv. 

This full day is around 1800 cals give or take. It’s harder to track when your not making your own food but that’s ok  just be mindful if you want to still count  make better decisions through the day if your having a big evening meal and dessert  but also it’s ok to have a break too and just enjoy your scran

Seems like you all wanted this one  so here we go  This was incredibly easy to make and incredibly easy to eat  It was soo good  

This recipe is to feed one. 

Prep time  10 mins
Cooking time  22 mins 

• preheat oven to 200 for fan over  alter accordingly for your appliance
• melt a tsp of Lurpak light in bottom of small oven dish est. 5 mins
• finely chop half onion and add to dish  covering all in the melted butter.
• place cod loin on top of onion. Salt and pepper to taste.
• chop up your chosen veg and arrange in dish. Also cover with melted butter and/or spray a few sprays of Fry Light just to avoid chatting the veg too much. 
• mix a tsp of light mayo with a palm sized amounts of cheddar. Add pepper and mixed herbs. I added a bit of garlic purée and extra parsley too. If you can go fresh with the herbs it will be even better. 
• spread the cheesy mixture on top of fish.
• Pop in oven for 22 mins or until cod fakes easily. 
• I had half a pouch of white rice. You can enjoy alone or add some rice/potato for a fuller meal  

This meal  with rice  is around 500cals of absolute sexiness

1837,gabbydawnallen,influencers,"  WHAT I EAT IN A DAY   

I’m going to start doing these as I get asked a LOT about what food I eat    for recipes  I will start doing those too  

This was a meat free Monday 
- porridge today yes I am a oat lover now  with lots of berries and a hint of cinnamon and 180 ml unsweetened almond milk 
- about 4x Carrot and humus snack
- protein pot  small can of beans and 2x veggie sausage  2x scrambled egg with spinach 
- protein shake  this one is vanilla protein powder 20g  blueberries  unsweetened almond milk 200ml  the other half the banana from earlier  collagen powder 
- tray bake veg  Green beans  kale  broccoli  courgette  onion  peppers
125g basmati rice 
150g Linda McCartney veggie chicken pieces which are BANGING 
- marsh and mallow bar  UNREAL 

- I also take lots of supplements/vitamins

This is around the 1600kcal mark. I tend to eat around 1600-1700 on average atm as I’m finding I am progressing towards what I want as I am training quite consistently too. If i wanted to see results quicker I might drop 100-200 calories but the main thing is to feel energised and nourished  And boy can food do that. 

It is important that you work out your own specific calorie goals  if calorie counting is what you want to do . Don’t take mine as a guideline as we are all different. But the main thing is  we ALL need lots of protein   getting that in is half the battle. 

I think you see a pretty substantial amount of food here because I LOVE it  never be afraid of eating  Food is our fuel  it’s what keeps us alive. Enjoy it just make good choices 80  of the time and you will be all gravy baby  P.s. LOVE gravy X"

1856,gabbydawnallen,influencers,"Today  I trained for my mental health. I needed to feel strong   this was the quickest way to do that. 

I packed my bag for the gym  took my tripod  and my pad with me and had planned on filming content for my Shape Uppers. Then there was a spanner thrown in the works and my brain was frazzled  my emotions were tested and all I wanted to do was go home and get in bed. But I didn’t. I dragged my sorry ass to the gym and I put my legs and ass through hell. 

I have had a bit of a shit time this year. 2021 certainly was NOT my year. I cannot wait for it to be over tbh 

So much is going on in my head  I put so much pressure on myself to do better and be better and in all honesty it’s been frigin hard to be my best this year. I’ve had a terrible time with my house as we know  that really has taken its toll and then other private things have been going on too which have my head frazzled . I try my best to stay upbeat on my stories but damnnn sometimes I feel like throwing my phone down a drain and taking next flight to bali to work at a beach bar  live AT the beach bar   call myself Fredrika.

If I could describe 2021 in three words it would be   overwhelming  lost  frustrating. 

I don’t wanna delve too deep as I still would like to keep most of my problems behind closed doors    I don’t think we have time tbh anyway   also  honestly  I feel ridiculous writing this tbh for fear of sounding dramatic or ungrateful which I’m scared some of you may see me as. 

The reason I am writing this though is because I feel like I needed to. I know I’m late to the mental health day party but I do feel like seeing everyone else’s posts re that  did give me the oomph to share a little with you too. 

I don’t think I have actually even shared anything with you other than letting you know how I’m feeling today. This caption doesn’t actually really say anything at all  it’s just a load of waffle   thats what it’s like in my head atm too 

But hopefully that’s enough and it also gives someone else a bit of comfort knowing someone else is having a shitty day too.

On Sunday  my brother  eeallen  is running the London Marathon  But what makes it even better is he is raising money for an AMAZING charity   brainstrustuk 

As you may well know  our dad passed away from a Glioblastoma Multiforme  a aggressive brain tumour  nearly 9 years ago at the age of 54. Although he tried all sorts of chemo  radio therapy  home remedies  trials and fought to the bitter end  which in grand total from diagnosis to passing was 10 months  there was nothing he or we could do to beat the big C. 

When diagnosed with a brain tumour it is terrifying  for the person carrying the tumour and the family. Brain cancer is one of the least researched cancers even though it is one of the biggest killers. 

 brainstrustuk however helped my dad and my family to process the news and learn to live with it as best as possible. They were there for my dad and my mum throughout    I know my dad really found comfort there too. 

The people who dedicate their lives to helping those who come to  brainstrustuk really are special and that’s why whenever our family are raising    we give it to them first  We won’t ever get our dad back but we can try help others in our situation as much as we can. 

Ethan  eeallen  is running the London Marathon raising money for  brainstrustuk in aid of our amazing  incredibly missed dad  Mike Allen. And he is going to absolutely F smash it for you dad  

Please donate anything you can through the link in my bio and also  if you could take a moment to send my amazing brother a message of support and encouragement  He doesn’t need it as he’s more than ready for take off  but it’s nice to be nice and it won’t go unnoticed  Thank you. "

Two of the most important things in a girl s life right  

As we know  my job is fitness so keeping my energy levels regulated is an absolute necessity but it s just as important for me to look after my hair.  I have to do the most to protect  nourish and strengthen my hair as it goes through a lot with being pulled back in training and then weekend styling with heat  products etc so I get the best of both worlds with the  jshealthvitamins for Hair and Energy. 

This vitamin serves two purposes in one  like JSHealth s other vitamins which I think is brilliant.  The hair and energy capsules are filled with iodine which comes from 2 forms of kelp which is amazing for hair  nail and skin reproduction and health. Iodine ALSO helps regulate metabolism and energy production throughout the body  to boost your energy and keep it strong all day long  The capsules also have a dose of Zinc which contributes to the maintenance of normal hair and skin

40 secs on 20 rest x 3

 of course you have to do both sides equally so beg/int split the 40 secs over both sides   adv. do 40 sec for one side   

1. Windmill reach- slide one arm down. Leg and reach other up  Try not to send hip out  you want to be using both sides of obliques to get you up and down
2. Standing twist and crunch- slight bend in the knees and contract through the centre x3 rotations then two oblique crunches. This surprisingly burns 
3. Same side hip dips- wow this is savaaage. Drop hip to 1 inch off mat then use obliques to pull hips back up  squeeze and pause one sec at top- 12 each side 
4. Oblique tucks- ouchhhhhh… use cushion of booty to find balance.. 12 each side 
5. 4 criss cross reach  4 oblique crunch- straight forward  Head and shoulders off always
6. Window wipers- tough    Can be done with bent legs    Aim is to keep hips on floor as you wipe side to side  

Let me know how you get on

30 secs each 15 rest x4 
30 - 45 sec rest between circuits 

1. Reverse crunch and star legs - legs only as low as you back can stay on floor 
2. Three way kick outs- can slide heels on floor if too hip flexor-y
3. Low plank knee taps - hips down people 
4. Flutter kicks- arms extended above head if possible but if not nee behjnd head. 
5. Plank climb and pike- keep knee up to nose in contraction as you hinge hips back. 

Actively use your lower abs for EVERY exercise. Even if it means slowing it down to think about the activation.

‏Recorded at  core.riyadh 

‏More people ask me about hamstrings and focus on the back of their legs more than quads. But for me  going crazy on my quads has been a game changer and helped shape and sculpt my body MASSIVELY  
‏I’m currently back at training  I do lower body 3 times a week. One flute focused  one hamstring focused and one quad focused. However  you have to get enough rest  eat enough of the right stuff and DEFINITELY stretch out if you want to train your lower body 3 times a week. Even though each session is focused on a different muscle  you will still hit the surrounding muscles.

‏WARM UP  10 min uphill walking. Incline 10-15
‏WORKING SETS  
‏4x12 Bulgarian split squats
‏4x45 second Wall squat
‏4x12 Leg extensions
‏4x12 Front cable squat

تمارين للافخاذ الامامية
مسجلة في نادي كور في الرياض  core.Riyadh

من خبرتي معظم البنات مركزين اكثر و يسالوني اكثر عن الافخاذ الخلفية بس مو الامامية. بس اسمعيني لما اقولك الافخاذ الامامية مررررره غيرت رسمة جسمي بشكل رهيب.
رجعت التمرين دحين و تركيزي انه جسمي يكون كيرفي او زي ما يقولو  الساعة الرملية  ف اتمرن اسفل الجسم ثلاث مرات في الاسبوع. مره التركيز على الارداف، مره التركيز على الافخاذ الخلفية و مره الامامية. بس شرط و شرط كبير انك ترتاحي/تنامي كويس و تاكلي كويس عشان العضلات تلحق ترتاح و ‏ ‏تتعافى و ضروري تمارين اطالة/تمديد. لانه صح الجلسة مركزة على عضلة معينة بس اكيد العضلات ‏المحيطة تشتغل و تنفعل شوية كمان.

تسخين  ١٠ دقايق مشي ارتفاع عالي بين ١٠-١٥

٤ مجموعات لكل تمرين و كل مجموعة فيها ١٢ تكرار.

2104,itsalwayshana,influencers,"‏The last 6-7 weeks I’ve trained about 5 times. Fasting  travelling  not been in the mood  haven’t had enough energy or sometimes even time. 
‏I’ve eaten anything   everything my heart desired   enjoyed every single bite 
‏Ppl always ask me ‘how can u be a ‘fitness person’   eat that or do this  ’ The answer is simply  because I want to. 

‏Fitness isn’t a specific shape. It’s something I do because I want to test my boundaries  my capabilities   above all to take care of my self. I see fitness as a reward  not a punishment or something ‘I have to do’   I definitely don’t see it as a restriction. It adds balance to my life   keeps my mind focused.
‏There’s a misconception that if you stop training all your hard work will just vanish.. well right now I’m sitting at 74kg   can still see abs  yes I’m holding a lil bit more fat but I’ve also probably eaten my body weight in sugar.. weekly lol. 
‏That being said summer is here   my motivation   energy is back

اخر ٦-٧ اسابيع اظن اتمرنت بس ٥ مرات.
صيام و سفر و يا ما كان عندي وقت ولا ما كان ليا نفس.
و ابشركم اكلت زي المفجوعة. اي شي و كل شي في خاطري اكلته.
كثير ناس يقولو انتي كيف  فتنس  و تاكلي كذا ولا تسوي كذا؟ 
الجواب الصريح عشان ابغى اكل ولا اسوي كذا. 
الفتنس مو بس شكل واحد و الاسباب اللي تخلي الشخص يتمرن يختلف من شخص لشخص. انا ما بسوي هذا كله عشان احرم نفسي من شي. انا العب فتنس عشان اكتشف قدرات جسمي، اقوي نفسي و احسها نوع من انواع الاهتمام بنفسي و جسمي. ما احس انه شي لازم اسوي اجباري بالنسبة لي شي ابغى اسويه و انبسط لما اسويه و اقدر اركز اكثر ، ترى الحياة توازن.

المهم دحين وزني ٧٤ كيلو و لسا شايفة عضلات بطني. كثير ناس يحسبوا بس توقفي تمرين انه خلاص كل مجهودك يروح و هذا مو صحيح.
دحين صيف و طاقتي و نفسية التمرين رجعت ف حاركز على تمارين لحرق الدهون و كارديو و تمارين مركبة و طبعا تمارين لاسفل الجسم ، ‏تابعوني عشان تشوفي التمارين و كمان حاوريكم ايش اكل عشان كثير ناس يسالوني ايش اكل في اليوم عشان انحف او اكبر.

Uhhh this may look easy  but trust me it’s not. By the time I got to the last exercise I was shaking  Core isn’t always my favourite to train but I can’t bang on about the benefits of having a strong core enough  It won’t only help you on ab days but on allll your training days and of course day to day activities.

Focus on your form  there’s no need to speed through the exercises  make sure you build that mind to muscle connection and you will definitely feel the burn

2109,itsalwayshana,influencers,"It would be so easy to put a quote about loving the skin you’re in on this photo especially because recently I feel like my skin has been working against me. Maybe it’s all the travelling  different time zones  sleep pattern and weather but whatever it is it really had me down. And yes I know beauty is more than skin deep but anyone that has struggled with any type of skin condition  rashes  acne ect I’m sure can relate. Having healthy skin really is a confidence booster.

The second slide is the current skin care routine I use  I got all my products from  asallure 
When I was in dubai I did a zoom consultation with her and she shipped out the products to me. I love that  asallure keeps it simple and doesn’t overwhelm me with loads of stuff I HAVE to do. I barely have time for I take off my makeup most days so having a routine that is effective and time efficient is really key.

Alssssoooo  asallure currently have a 10  Ramadan discount on their products 

My other skin tip would be H20. No joke  water does miracles for your skin so try to keep hydrated as much as possible.

Also shout out  thesalon.dubai for always keeping my lashes fresh when I’m in dubai

Either directly before breaking fast  so when I finish training I can have something to drink and eat. Or an hour after I break fast so I have time to digest and can still have a pre workout and it’s not too late.

My focus is to drop some body fat so my meals are very protein focused.
I try to fit in 3 meals and 2 snacks a day. Smaller portions than usual as I’m not training as intensely or as much.

Ideally my eating should be 
6 30 break fast  meal 1
11- meal 2
3 30 close fast  meal 3
 
Still trying to get in about 3.5 litres of water and having fruits as snacks in between the meals.

متى اتمرن في رمضان

الاختيار الاول- قبل الفطور عشان اول ما اخلص تمرين اقدر اكل و اشرب

او الاختيار الثاني بعد الافطار بساعة عشان الحق اهضم الاكل و لسا اقدر اخذ مشروب طاقة و ما ياثر على نومي. 

هدفي اخسر دهون ف وجباتي اكثر شي بروتين. 
عشان جلساتي مو نفس الطاقة/كثافة و ما اتمرن كل يوم بخلي اكلي اخف و حجم الوجبة نفسها اصغر. 

احاول اكل ٣ وجبات و ٢ سناك.
١٨ ٣٠ تقريبا الوجبة ‏الأولى
٢٣ ٠٠ الوجبة الثانية
٣ ٣٠ سحور

Switching up range of motion  different types of weights and handles definitely made it more engaging.

‘My back/neck hurts when I’m training abs’ is one of THE most common things I hear. Whilst most ab exercises are performed on the ground there are other exercises that don’t include laying down that can be great for results and to build up your muscles until you learn and get comfortable with the correct form for floor ab exercises.

Remember to keep your movements slow and controlled. Contracting your ab muscles will cause your back to curl slightly but that’s ok and correct whilst performing ab exercises.

Remember exercise is only half of it  if you’re looking to burn fat then you’ll need to be in calorie deficit  eating less calories than you burn. Not drastically  as you don’t want your body to store instead.

تمارين دمبل لإسفل الجسم

مو لازم ‏تجلسي في النادي وتتمرني بالساعات او تلعبي تمارين كثير عشان تشوفي نتايج. انا احاول العب ٤-٦ تمارين حديد لكل جلسة مع ‏تحمية قبل و شي بدون اوزان في النهاية.
هذي التمارين لعبت قبلها تمارين تحمية و تشغيل بربط مقاومة و بعدها ٢٠ دقيقة على جهاز الدرج.
حاولي ترفعي الوزن مع كل مجموعة و تلعبي مجموعتين على اثقل وزن قدرتي عليه.

٤ مجموعات لكل تمرين و كل مجموعة فيها ١٠ تكرارات.

1⃣خلي وقفتك واسعة و دفي حوضك للخلف عشان تقربي الوزن للارض. انحناء بسيط في الركب و الظهر مستقيم. لما اوصل لاسفل نطاق الحركة احرك الوزن لقدام عشان اطول تحت الضغط و كمان حركة الوزن حتنقل تركيز الوزن و تخلي عضلاتي المستهدفة تشتغل اكثر.
2⃣خلي وقفتك واسعة و انزلي سكوات. لمًا توصلي لاسفل نطاق الحركة انبضي بتحكم عشان تزيدي الضغط على عضلات الارداف.
3⃣امسكي الوزن قدامك و رجعي رجلك خلفك بشكل قطري. لا تضيقي وقفتك خلي زاوية ركبك ٩٠ درجة. بدلي بين الجهتين.
4⃣نفس التمرين الاول بس هذي المره وقفتك اقرب. و انتي نازلة دفي ركبك للخارج بس شوية.
5⃣ارفعي الوزن فوق راسك. جربي اول شي وزن مره خفيف لانه لمًا يكون فوق راسك حتى الوزن الخفيف تحسي ثقيل. رجعي رجل خلفك و خلي لنفسك مساحة عشان زاوية ركبك تكون ٩٠. لا تخلي ركبتك تلمس الارض بين كل تكرار.

تمارين الجسم العلوي

هذي التمارين التركيز على تكرارات متحكمة لمدة دقيقة. لا يغرك الوزن الخفيف لما تتحكمي في التكرارات لمدة دقيقة تحسي بحرقان مو طبيعي. طبعا لو حابة تقدري ترفعي الوزن بس لا تضحي بالتكنيك. انا لعبت هذي التمارين و بعدها تمارين لحرق الدهون و خلاص حسيت اني بموت.

لعبت ٤ جولات لكل تمرين و كل جولة مدتها دقيقة و حاولي ما تاخدي راحة كثير بين الجولات و التمارين. 

1⃣و انتي واقفة ارفعي يدك للجنب لين توصلي نفس مستوى كتفك. بالراحة لفي يدك عشان الوزن يكون فوق. خلى الارتفاع ثابت و احني كوعك و قربي الوزن اتجاه اذنك عشان تشغلي عضلات البايسبس. 
2⃣احني جسمك من حوضك و ظهرك لسا مستقيم اسحبي الاوزان اتجاه بطنك و خلي مكان كوعك ثابت و رجعي يدك لخلفك عشان تضغطي على عضلات الترايسبس. و يدك مستقيمة ارفعي الوزن لقدامك لاستهداف الاكتاف.
3⃣و انتي جالسة ارفعي يدك للجنب مثل التمرين الاول لمًا توصلي مستوى كتفك خلي يدك مستقيمة و جيبي الوزن قدامك.
4⃣و انتي جالسة على ركبك احني جسمك من حوضك بس خلي ظهرك مستقيم و رقبتك مرتاحة. خلي يدك مستقيمة و ارفعي الوزن لخلفك لين تحسي الواح كتفك تبغى تلمس بعض، ضروري تتحكمي في الحركة و ما تبالغي. ارجعي نزلي يدك بشكل مستقيم و اسحبي الوزن اتجاه بطنك عشان تشغلي عضلات ظهرك.

تمارين الارداف على جهاز الكيبل

اوووووف قد ايش انبسط بهذي التمارين. مع اني بتشغل نفس العضلات بس التغيرات الصغيرة في الوقفة و الجهاز مره خلتني احس بالتمرين. لا تستعجلي التمارين، خذيهم بالراحة و ابني علاقة تواصل بينك و بين عضلاتك. لا تخافي تعدلي وقفتك و وضعك لين تحسي بالتمرين صح. 

1⃣انحي شوية من حوضك بس خلي ظهرك مستقيم. خلي كمان انحاء بسيط في ركبتك في الجهة اللي ما تلعبيها و رجعي رجلك الثانية للخلف بس لا ترفعيها كثير عن الارض. حاولي تضغطي على العضلة طول التمرين مو بس لما توصلي اخر نطاق الحركة.
2⃣نفس وقفة التمرين الاول بس هذي المرة رجعي رجلك وراكي باتجاه زاوية  الحركة موضحة بالفيديو  بعدين جيبي للجنب. خلي ارتفاع رجلك عن الارض ثابت طول التمرين.
3⃣حطي مات تحتك عشان ما تعوري ركبك و اربطي المسكة على الجهة الابعد عن الجهاز. خلي ظهرك مستقيم و ارفعي ركبتك للجنب و في نفس الوقت نزلي جسمك شوية لتحت عشان تزيدي الضغط على العضلة.
4⃣اجلسي على الارض و ثبتي وضعك بيدك جبنك أو وراكي. رجعي ظهرك للخلف بس شوية عشان تكبري المسافة لنفسك. مدي رجلك بشكل مستقيم، ارفعيها عن الارض و دفيها للخارج واتحكمي بالحركة.

Trust me when I tell you I loooovve my food  I’m also an emotional eater so how much I eat really depends on my mood. I’ve always fluctuated with weight and that’s ok because it’s normal.

I hate the word diet or the concept of dieting. Instead I try to change how I look at food and realise the benefits of what I give myself. Do I eat chocolate and donuts and fast food  Yes. But I also try to give my self good  beneficial foods that help my body nutritionally as well as aesthetically. Finding balance is what it’s all about and once you see results  be it how you look  how you feel and/or your performance enhancing  it gets a lot easier.
It also helps that nutritional education and ‘healthy’ meals have come so far recently as the fitness and self care trend has grown. Eating healthy no longer has to be boring  it’s not rice  broccoli and unseasoned chicken as many would assume.
 proteinhouse uae is the an amazing example of that.
Food is your friend  don’t ever deprive yourself of it or starve yourself to lose weight. That’s not how it works. Nourish your body and cherish it.

2. Ronnie’s obviously missed me so starts to photobomb. 
3. Raife who hasn’t missed me as much but is the ultimate wind up  loves Ronnie’s idea and jumps on the photobomb band wagon.
4. Raife decides to take things to extreme measures.

Okay so let me start by saying this is not a boxing video. My boxing coordination is actually laughable. However because I refuse to stop loving food so much  I do need all the cardio I can get  Finding different forms of cardio that make it go buy quicker and keep me more engaged are a win for me. Often having a combined movement of two or more exercises really does the trick for me.
Hitting hard here is not the goal- however there is no harm in indulging and getting some anger out at the same time lol. 

Don’t sacrifice form for speed  keep your back straight  neck comfortable and always make sure your knees are pointed outwards  the same direction as your feet.

I can not stress enough how important stretching is. You need to make time for it even if it’s a 5 minute cool down at the end of every session or even have a dedicated day each week to focus on stretching  yoga ect. 
If you’re training has been kind of stunted or you’re not seeing the muscle growth you should  it might be connected to your muscles being over tightened. You’re whole body is connected so stretching out your hamstrings can also help ease your lower back and help with him mobility and glute growth.

I did each movement 3-5 times for 30 seconds. If I’m alternating sides then I do them for a minute.

تمارين الاطالة مره مره مهمة. ما اقدر اقولكم قد ايش مهمة و مفيدة. اوقات ما تشوفي تقدم في تدريبك و ‏نمو عضلات و احتمال كبير السبب في ضيق عضلاتك من كثر التدريب و قلت الاطالة. حاولي تلعبي تمارين اطالة بعد كل جلسة حتى لو بس ٥ دقايق و حتشوفي فرق كبير و ممكن كمان تخصصي يوم الاطالة او يوقا.
الجسم كله مربوط ببعضه ف تخفيف ضيقة الافخاد ممكن يريح اسفل ظهرك، اردافك و كمان حوضك. 

الاطالة زي القوة تزيد تدريجيا و لازم تستمري.

Mind to muscle connection is imperative when training. Slow down your movements and keep them controlled to allow more time under tension.

بديت أحس الفترة الاخيرة كثرو الناس اللي صارو مرتاحين و هم يجرحو الاخرين و ينشرو عبارات سلبية. الصورة الثانية بس مثل و من التعليقات اللي شفتها. أنا تربيت اني ما اتدخل في احد و إذا ما عندي شيء كويس او مفيد اقوله، فا الافضل اني ما اتكلم ابداً. 
اكيد فاهمة أنه مو الكل اتربى على نفس الطريقة.
بس ترى الكلام ويجرح و احنا ما نعرف ايش ممكن يكون الشخص بيمر فيه في حياته و ما نعرف ليش بيعمل اللي بيعمله حتى اذا كنت ما توافقه في اللي بيعمله إذا ما أذاك فلا تحاول تأذيه. من جد ايش تحس و تستفيد؟

أسوي اللي اسويه لانه يخليني مبسوطة ومرتاحة.
انا بسوي اللي احبه و لاني انبسط فيه و انبسط لما اشوف جسمي يتغير و يتجاوب بسبب تعبي و التزامي. انبسط بدفع قدراتي واكتشاف حدودي و مرررره أنبسط بمشاركة رحلتي و اللي تعلمته على طول الطريق معكم.  أنا مني هنا عشان اخذ موافقة احد ولا ابغى أو أحتاج أو يهمني رأي احد في شكلي ، وتاكد مليون انه لا انا ولا اي امرأة تانية أو أي إنسان بشكل عام موجود عشان يكون الشخص اللي تفرغ فيه الطاقات السلبية بالتعليقات و التجريح من اي نوع.

 طبعا يمديني ارد بنفس الكراهية و التجريح على هذول الناس بس هذا مو انا و غلط على غلط ما يساوي صح. صراحة هذول الناس اكثر ناس محتاجين الحب لانهم لو كانوا يعرفو السعادة ولا الحب سوا لنفسهم او لغيرهم ما حيكون عندهم وقت او نية او داعي انهم يجرحو و ينشرو الكره بمثل هاذي التعليقات.
. اللي متصالح مع نفسه ما يحاول يجرح غيرو بالعكس يحاول يتفادى التجريح.
المهم- اسفة على الكابتشن الطويل بس حبيت اتكلم شوية عن الموضوع و اي شخص، و ياريت نعامل بعض بلطف اكثر.

This is always going to be my favourite machine. There’s so many variations you can do and because it’s quite restricted there’s not a lot of margin for error. 
However focus on keeping ur back straight  your neck comfortable and don’t forget to breathe  sounds basic I know but you would be surprised at how many people hold there breath when training.

I play around with my rep ranges  sometimes I’ll go light and high reps 15-25 and other times I’ll go heavy 8-12 reps. Both work  both have benefits.

٥ وضعيات مختلفة على جهاز الارداف

تخيلو ترجمة اسم الجهاز على كلام قوقل  جهاز المختطف  هههههه ترى مره صعب اوقات الاقي ‏المصطلحات الصحيحة و ‏أسماء الاجهزة ف لو اوقات لقيتو شوية فلسفة من عندي عادي لا تستغربوا

المهم هذا الجهاز عشقي. ممتاز للارداف و منطقة الخفسة. الفرق بين الوضعيات هو بس جهة استهداف العضلة بس هي نفس العضلة.

اهم شي ظهرك دائما مستقيم. رقبتك مرتاحة و شي ثاني، لا تكتمي انفاسك- التنفس مره مهم.

‏بالنسبة للتكرارات  احب انوع. وزن خفيف و تكرار عالي بين ١٥-٢٥ و كمان وزن ثقيل و تكرارات اقل من ٨-١٢ الاثنين لهم فايدة.

You can do these exercises as complete workout  but go for 4-5. Sets of 20.
Or you can do these workouts as pre exhaust- glute activation before your lower body weight session  3 sets of 20 should be enough.

Regardless of how you use them if your goal is to build then on the day you need to make sure you’re in a calorie surplus and use those calories on foods high in carbohydrates and protein rather than sugar and fried foods.
However if your goal is to burn then go for the opposite and be in a calorie deficit  by only 20  not more than that.
I say 20  because a lot of people have the wrong idea when they’re trying to cut weight and end up hungry. U should never feel hungry even when you’re trying to cut weight.
Anything more than 20  one of two things happens  1 you drop weight quickly but in an unhealthy way and as soon as you start eating properly again you put on all the weight you lost and more. Or 2 you don’t drop any weight and could potentially even gain more because your body has no idea when it’s going to get its next meal and instead goes into a sort of protection mode and stores any and all food you eat.

تمارين للارداف بربط مقاومة

تقدري تلعبي هذي التمارين كجلسة لحالها  بس زودي المجموعات خليها ٤ او ٥ من ٢٠ 
او تقدري تلعبي التمارين كاحماء للارداف قبل جلسة الاوزان لاسفل الجسم  ٣ مجموعات من ٢٠ كفاية 
في الحالتين لو هدفك التكبير لازم تغذيتك تكون مناسبة و لازم يومها تكوني اكلة سعرات عالية- بس نظيفة. يعني كاربوهيدرات و بروتين مو سكر و مقلي.
و لو هدفك التنحيف اعملي العكس و كلي سعرات اقل من احتياجاتك  بس ٢٠٪؜ اقل  عشان جسمك يفهم انك تبغي تحرقي من الدهون اللي عندك. ليش قلت ٢٠٪؜ لانه كثير ناس فاهمين التنحيف غلط و يجوعو نفسهم و اللي يصير شي من الاثنين. اول شي ينحفو بس مو بطريقة صحية و اول ما يرجعو يعلوا كمية السعرات يرجعوا كل الوزن اللي نزلوا يا الشي الثاني ما ينحفوا بل عكس تطلع لهم دهون في اماكن مختلفة و هذا عشان جسمك يحب النظام و ما صار عندة نظام او مواعيد ثابتة الاكل /تغذية ف يقلب و يصير جسمك يخزن كل شي من الوجبات اللي تاكليها كنوع من الحماية.

لا تنسي تقفلي المسافة اللي بينك و بين الارض و لا ترفعي نفسك برقبتك دائما عضلات بطنك. تمارين البطن التمارين الوحيدة اللي مسموحة انك تلفي ظهرك فيها شوية عشان تضغطي علي عضلات البطن صح بس لا تبالغي.

So two days ago I messed up my shoulder   neck  could barely turn my head   was advised to take a week off of training. Obviously me being me I didn’t listen   went to train legs today.. only to pop my knee out mid session   have to have it pushed back into place. It was so bad I couldn’t even extend my leg. Good proof that everything in your body is connected   that I’m stubborn af   sometimes being stubborn isn’t the one but we move. Pun intended.
In other news  my previous stretching video  the lower back pain one has over 22k saves on it so I got the gist you guys liked it   thought I’d share some of my fav glute stretches. If you feel like you’re stuck   your glutes aren’t growing  them being tight might be apart of the reason why. Lower back pain can also be caused by tight glutes so these stretches are definitely good to add into your training.
I tend to do them after I have trained.
Learn from my mistakes peeps   keep stretching a regular in your routine to avoid injuries as much as possible.

Make sure you keep your movements slow   controlled  there’s no need to rush.
Do each move for 1 min   repeat 3-5 times.

So first of all let’s clear up a misconception  hip dips are actually your bone structure and every single person has them. It just shows more on some than others. However out of personal experience over the years I have noticed a clear difference in mine and how they have ‘filled out’. I’ve done this by doing two different things training wise.
1- dropping my body fat percentage. Which i feel has flattened the top bulge.
2- train glutes  a lot  and more specifically focusing on abductor movements where my leg is moving away from my body in a side ways manner.

When training I’m always conscious of my knee position  even when doing more leg focused or compound movements. I’ll always have my knees slightly to the outside of my feet to active and use my abductors. Like in exercise 3 when I’m squatting.

Of course matching you’re food with your training goes without saying. On my burn days I’ll have low carbs. On my build days  high carbs. Protein consistent.

‎تمارين للخفسة
‎و بعض الحقائق و المعلومات 

‎اوكي اول شي بشاركم بعض المعلومات المغلوطة عن الخفسة
‎ لازم نعرف انه ظهور الخفسة هو جزءً من تركيبة العظام و موجودة عند الكل- الكلللللل- الفرق بس انها ممكن تكون اوضح او بارزة اكثر عند بعض الناس. 
‎من تجربتي الشخصية ، اقدر اقول لكم اني لاحظت تحسن مره كبير مع التدريب و طبعا التغذية وركزت على حاجتين في نفس الوقت.
‎اول شي- انزل نسبة الدهون في جسمي و هذا اللي ساعد في تخفيف/تنعيم الطلعة اللي فوق  اللي اصلا مكونة من الدهون 
‎ثاني شي ، تكبير اقرب عضلة لمنطقة الخفسة اللي هي الارداف و بالذات الارداف الجانبية..فا  ركزت على التمارين اللي رجلي تبعد عن جسمي بشكل جانبي.

‎و اتاكد انه حتى لما العب تمارين للارجل او تمارين مركبة، دائما اركز ان اتجاه ركبتي للخارج اكثر من رجلي بس بشوية. مثل الفيديو الثالث و انا اتمرن سكوات.

‎طبعا التغذية تلعب دور مره مهم. ايام الحرق خليت اكلي خفيف من ناحية  كاربوهيدرات. و ايام التكبير خليت اكلي عالي كاربوهيدرات. البروتين ثابت.

‎كل تمرين ٤ مجموعات-المجموعة  ٢٠ تكرار. لا تنسي تلعبي الجهتين

CHEST WORKOUT

Imma say this one and once only  CHEST EXERCISES WORK YOUR CHEST MUSCLES NOT YOUR BOOBS. Please read that again because the amount of accounts and even ‘trainers’ out there promoting chest workouts under the false pretence of them giving you a breast lift is INSANE. Any weighted exercises will always target your muscles and as we know boobs are made of fat. Your chest muscles are underneath your boobs so logically when you change or grow the muscle underneath your boobs will be affected but in no way shape or form anywhere like an operation. I know it’s not what you want to hear but I got to keep it real with you. That being said there are many  many benefits to training chest and making it apart of your workout routine.

جلسة ارداف في النادي

لعبت بعض التمارين باوزان ثقيلة و بعض التمارين باوزان خفيفة او من غير اوزان بس تكرارات عالية.

حبيت العب في سرعت التكرارات في بعض التمارين عشان اشوف ايش الفرق و فين احس فيه اكثر.

هذي التمارين تساعد على تكبير عضلات الارداف لكن ما تكفي لحالها. لازم تكملي تدريبك بتغذية مناسبة لأفضل النتايج.

‏Unpopular opinion but I actually find barbell deadlifts really boring.

‏Main things to focus on 
‏-Your back  your back and then your back some more. Don’t worry about hitting depth  focus on your form and keeping your back straight. Remember to hinge from your hip and only bend your knees ever so slightly when needed and simultaneously as you bend.
‏-Make sure your feet and knees are always pointing in the same direction and that your knees are never caved in/inside your feet.
‏-Keep your neck neutral with your chin slightly tucked in to avoid any strain.

٣ انواع مختلفة لتمرين الديدليفت

اكيد كثير ما ‏راح يتفقو معايا بس الديدليفت العادي بالبار احس تمرين ممل و طويل و افقد تركيزي ف افضل اسوي نفس التمرين/الحركة بس على جهاز الكبل او اوزان حرة.

صح بسوي وقفة مختلفة في كل تمرين بس في بعض الأشياء المشتركة في كل التمارين.

اول شي، ظهرك ظهرك ظهرك. لا تشيلي هم نطاق الحركة على قد ما تشيلي هم التكنيك عندك. انحي من حوضك مو من ركبك. انزلي قد ما تقدري و ظهرك مستقيم.
رجولك و ركبك دائما نفس الاتجاه و لا تخلي ركبك تنهار للداخل.
خلي رقبتك مرتاحة و نزلي دقنك شوية.

Lately I’m  trying to avoid doing any front focused shoulder workouts as I’m trying to focus on my rear more to help pin my shoulders back a bit.
I always adjust my training according to my goals. Every few months I review my progress and plan out what I’m going to focus on for the next few months.

Try to push yourself and use weights you feel are heavy for you. Obviously within reason but if you get to the 6th rep and aren’t tired  it’s a pretty good sign you could potentially go heavier.

So when I was invited to the  golf saudi    aramro series event I wasn’t too sure what to expect but I’d be lying if I said this event didn’t only blow my mind but also brought tears to my eyes.
Being around so many like minded people  especially women like  nawal.alkhalawi and  malbutairi who all share a love for sports and self development was so refreshing.
Seeing and experiencing how physical education and sports culture is being embraced by my fellow Saudis puts the biggest smile on my face.

We may not be known for being in the fitness and sports industry but let me be the first to tell you  we’re coming and we’re coming big 
The  aramco series and  golf saudi is a 4 part series  kicking off in London  then Sotogrande  the one I attended  next is New York and finishing in the city I was raised  Jeddah. With a massive cash prize of ONE MILLION DOLLARS 

To my babes in Saudi who are interested in learning more about golf  check out at programs  events and locations  amarco series and  golf saudi have set up all around Saudi.


أول ما جاتني دعوة من قولف السعودية عشان احضر بطولة أرامكو للفرق ما توقعت صراحة إني أشوف الي شفته اليوم، حقيقي مرة انبسطت بالتجربة برفقة الرائعين  nawal.alkhalawi و  malbutairi وجداً استمتعنا بتجربة القولف ومشاهدة البطولة من أرض الملعب 

متفائلة مرة بمستقبلنا في مجال الرياضة والصحة وإن شاء الله دايماً من نجاح إلى نجاح.

بعطيكم فكرة سريعة عن سلسلة بطولات أرامكو للفرق..
البطولة تتكون من 4 جولات بدأت في لندن ثم سوتوغراندي في اسبانيا والجولة القادمة بتكون في نيويورك وبعدها راح تكون الجولة الأخيرة في جده

Every time I post a chest workout I have to stress how these workouts will not make your boobs bigger  although there is no lack of false advertisement claiming that they do  unfortunately they don’t. These workouts will work your chest muscle  not the breast tissue/fat. 
Increasing your muscle size may slightly increase your overall breast size and slightly lift them.. but nowhere the same as an operation.

Changing the angle of your bench will help you target and emphasis different parts of your chest muscle.

Incline will emphasise working your upper chest  decline will do the opposite and work lower.

تمارين للصدر-
التركيز على الصدر العلوى

كل مره انزل فديو عن تمارين الصدر تجيني نفس ‏سؤال عشرين الف مره و حابة اوضح المعلومة، مره ثانية،
تمارين الصدر ما تكبر الصدر نفسه.
تمارين الصدر تكبر عضلة الصدر اللي خلف الدهون.
صح اذا كبرتي العضلة ممكن حجم صدرك يتغير و يترفع شوية بس ابدا مو مثل العمليات.

لما تغيري ‏زاوية الكرسي تغيري أي جزء من العضلة مستهدفة اكثر شي. الكرسي مرفوع، مثل في الفديو، تستهدفي ‏الجزء العلوي من العضلة. لو نزلتي الكرسي تستهدفي ‏الجزء الاسفل من عضلة الصدر.

بس لا تنسي التمارين نص الموضوع النص الثاني التغذية.
لو حابة تحرقي لازم تاكلي ‏سعرات حرارية اقل من اللي تاكليها. مو بكثير عشان جسمك ما يخزن الاكل بس بشوية. المفروض حتى لما تبغي تنحفي ما مفروض تحسي بالجوع. اوقات لازم تغيري نوع الاكل اللي تاكلي مو شرط الكمية.

Of course you can add in some weights or bands to make it harder but that’s doesn’t mean you won’t get results when training body weight.
You’ve got to apply pressure to the muscle either with weights and bands or upping your intensity with reps and less rest time.
Of course the main differentiating factor between growing or shredding is your food.

طبعا تقدري تضيفي اوزان عشان تخلي التمارين اصعب لو تبغي لبس هذا ما يعني انك مما تشوفي نتايج من غير اوزان. اهم شي نضغط على العضل، يا بالاوزان يا بالتكرارات و طبعا اهم عنصر للتكبير او تنحيف، التغذية. ف لا تنسي تاكلي حسب هدفك.

1⃣خلي يدك تحت مكان كتفك و خلى ظهرك مستقيم. ارفعي رجلك لفوق بزاوية ٩٠ درجة و انبضي و انتي ‏ضاغطة على العضلة فوق.
2⃣نامي على جنبك و خلي كوعك تحت كتفك. اشري باصبع رجلك و ارفعي رجلك لفوق و نزلي قدامك. لا تريحي في اسفل نطاق الحركة.
3⃣نامي ‏على ظهرك وقفلي المسافة اللي بينك وبين الأرض. ‏خلي رجولك نفس مسافة أكتافك و دفي من كعب رجلك و ارفعي نفسك عن الارض. مره خلي ‏رجلك كلها على الأرض و مره بس كعب رجلك.

So most of these workouts are tricep focussed but that doesn’t mean to say you won’t hit and work other surrounding muscles.

As usual I don’t want to gain any size on my upper body so I’m keeping my weights light  my reps high and my food intake on the day more protein focused.
However if u want to build  try the opposite  chose a weight you feel is heavy for you  keep your reps lower 8-12 and have a higher carb food intake on the day.

تمارين للجسم العلوي

معظم التمارين مركزة على الايادي الخلفية- الترايسبس بس هذا ما يعني انك محا تشغيلي العضلات المحيطة كمان.
باستخدم اوزان خفيفة، التكرارات عالية و بخلي اكلي خفيف من ناحية الكاربوهيدرات يومها عشان مني حابة اكبر ولا ازيد حجم العضل لاكن لو حابة تكبري سوي العكس. استخدمي وزن تحسي ثقيل عليكي خلي التكرارات اقل يعني بين ٨-١٢ و يومها خلي اكلك ‏عالي بالكاربوهيدرات.

لعبت كل تمرين ٣ مجموعات
و كل مجموعة فيها ٢٠ تكرار

1⃣خلي ظهرك على العلبة و ارفعي حوضك. رجعي يدي وراكي و خلي كوعك ثابت و قريب من راسك. خلى كوعك ثابت و ارفعي الوزن.
2⃣خلي يدك قريبة من بعض و حطيهم على العلبة عشان لما تنزلي يدك تكون تحت صدرك في النص. ‏ثبتي عضلاتك الأساسية و خلي جسمك مستقيم طول الحركة.
3⃣خلي ‏ظهرك على العلبة و امسكي الوزن بالطول و يدك بشكل مثلث. خلي ‏انحاء بسيط في كوعك و نزلي الوزن لخلف راسك. انا ترفعي الوزن قدامك جيبي لقريب صدرك.
4⃣خلي يدك قريبة من جسمك و ارفعي نفسك على العلبة. لما تنزلي خلي كوعك وراكي من جنبك. مدي رجلك لو حبيتي تخلي التمرين اصعب بس ‏في كل الأحوال ارفعي نفسك باستخدام يدك مو رجلك.
5⃣ ‏خلي ظهرك على العلبة وأمسكي الوزن بالطول عشان مسكتك تكون قريبة. خلي الوزن فوق صدرك و ارفعي بتحكم.

تمارين للحضر بدون اوزان

تعرفوا انا ما احب استخدم اوزان لتمارين الخصر عشان خلاص احس عندي تحديد كفاية في المنطقة و مني حابة اكبر بس لو انتي حاسة انه لسا تبغي تحديد او حجم شوية عادي تزيدي التمارين وزن و كمان لا تحسبي انه من مره وحدة خصرك مره بيطلع معضل. تقدري تتحكمي في مستوى التحديد او كبر العضل بالتغذية و مكان كثافة او كمية التدريب.
و ايوا التمارين للشباب كمان مو بس للبنات

1⃣اجلسي على رجولك و خلي يدك على اذنك و بالدور قربي كوعك لحوضك.
2⃣نامي على جنبك و كوعك اللي على الارض تحت كتفك و رجلك بشكل تسعين درجة. ارفعي رجلك الثانية و يدك على اذنك حاولي تقربي كوعك لركبتك و في نفس الوقت اضغطي على عضلات بطنك الجانبية.
3⃣اجلسي على اسفل ظهرك  و ارفعي رجولك عن الارض، خلي يدك على اذنك و لفي جسمك من فوق و حاولي تدقي كوعك و ركبتك الجهة العكس. 
4⃣نامي على ظهرك و ثبتي رجولك على الارض. مدي يدك لقريب رجولك و ارفعي اكتافك عن الارض. بالدور حاولي تقربي يدك كل جهة لرجلك نفس الجهة و في ‏نفس الوقت اضغطي على عضلات جانب بطنك.
5⃣نامي على ظهرك و يدك على اذنك ارفعي اكتافك عن الارض. بالدور قربي كوعك اليسار لركبتك اليمين و العكس صحيح.

Glute day also means high carb day so you know I’m a happy bunny. Adding weights is one of the easiest ways to apply pressure to your muscles to help them grow but that’s only the half of it. You need to make sure you’re eating a calorie surplus on the day if you’re looking to grow.. carbs are actually bae.

تمارين دمبل لتكبير الارداف

طبعا للانجليز لازم ‏ضغط على العضل و من اسهل الطرق انك تضغطي على العضلة إنك تضيفي وزن.
لاكن ‏عنصر ثاني يلعب دور كبير التغذية- لو حابة تكبري لازم تاكلي اكثر من ‏احتياجات جسمك عشان تبني.

باستخدم العلبة عشان تكسب ارتفاع و نطاق عادي تستخدمي كرسي بديل.

انا لعبت ٤ مجموعات لكل تمرين
و كل مجموعة فيها ١٠ تكرارات
الا التمرين الثاني ١٥ تكرار
لا تنسي تلعبي الجهتين.

1⃣ارفعي رجلك الخلفية و هذي خطوة لقدام عشان انا تنزلي عندك مسافة كفاية عشان ترسمي ٩٠ درجة الجهتين. تقدري تحطي الوزن قريب كتفك او تخلي يدك تحت اللي يريحك. دفي بكعب رجلك و خلي ركبك و ظهرك مستقيم طول الحركة. طالعي قدامك مو تحت.
2⃣اكسري وضع رجولك و خلي فلات على الارض و رجلك الثانية على الكعب. خلى اكتافك على العلبة و خلي دقنك لتحت. ارفعي جسمك و اضغطي على اردافك. العبي ٥ تكرارات بعدين غيري رجلك و خليهم الاثنين فلات على الارض كمان ٥ تكرارات و تكسري الوضع ثاني و خلي رجلك الثانية على الكعب.
3⃣اكسري وقفتك و خلي رجلك الخلفية على العلبة. انحي من حوضك و انزلي لين تحسي وصلتي ٩٠ درجة بظهرك.دفي وركك للخلف لما تنزلي و خلي دقنك نازل و ظهرك مستقيم.
4⃣حطي الوزن خلف ركبتك و قفلي عليه. خلى بطنك على العلبة و امسكي العلبة بيد من كل جهة للتوازن. بتحكم ارفعي رجلك لفوق اخر شي.

I’m using the box to give me a bigger range of motion but if u don’t have a box you can use a chair or anything else that will give you height. Worst case scenario you will still benefit from the exercises even if you do them on the ground. 

You can also add a resistance band to make the burn more intense. However when training body weight remember not to rush the exercises  build a mind to muscle connection and take the exercises slow and controlled to keep your muscles under tension longer.

تمارين للارداف و الخفسة

انا حاطة العلبة عشان اكسب ارتفع و بالتالي نطاق اكبر للحركة لو ما عندك عادي تستخدمي كرسي او اي شي ثاني يعطيكي ارتفع. في اسوا الاحوال عادي تسوي نفس التمارين على الارض.

لا تنسي التمارين اللي بدون اوزان عشان تحسي فيها لازم لازم لازم تركزي و تاخذي التمارين بالراحة عشان تخلي العضلة تحت الضغط اكثر تعويض عن الاوزان.

كمان عادي تضيفي ربط مقاومة.

لعبت ٤ مجموعات لكل تمرين و كل مجموعة فيها ١٢ تكرار.

1⃣ارفعي رجلك جهة وحدة و خذي خطوة واسعة و خلي اتجاه رجلك اللي على الارض للخارج شوية عشان لما تنزلي ركبتك تروح نفس الاتجاه و ما تحسي بضغط على ركبتك، انزلي لتسعين درجة و لا تنسي تلعبي الجهتين.
2⃣خلي ركبتك على جنب العلبة و يدك كل وحدة جهة عشان توزني نفسك. خلي رجلك الثاني مدلدل، ارفعي اصابيع رجلك و ارفعي بشكل مستقيم و متساوي مع رجلك الثانية قد ما تقدري. في نفس الوقت ثبتي عضلاتك الاساسية و اضغطي على عضلات اردافك.
3⃣نفس التمرين الثاني بس هذي المره اسحبي رجلك خلفك و لا تخلي ظهرك يتحرك.
4⃣نامي على العلبة و امسكي العلبة من قدام بيدك الاثنين. حطي رجل على رجل عشان تنحي ركبك و تخلي رجولك بشكل مثلث. انحي من حوضك و ارفعي رجولك قد ما تقدري و اضغطي على اردافك.

قوانين حرق الدهون 
نقص في السعرات الحرارية 
لا تفهمي غلط، مو تروحي تمنعي نفسك من الاكل ولا تفوتي وجبات و تجلسي جيعانة. لا هذا مو القصد ابدا. القصد انك تغيري نوع الاكل اللي تاكلي لأكل صحي و بالتالي رح يكون في سعارات اقل. خلي اكلك عالي بالبروتين مو كاربوهيدرات. لازم تاكلي سعرات اقل من كمية السعرات اللي تحرقها في اليوم عشان جسمك يأخذ باقي الطاقة المطلوبة من الدهون المخزنة و مو من اكلك.

لاحظت في الفترة الأخيرة اني مني حاسة ببعض التمارين زي اول ، مني قادرة استهدف اردافي ولا حاسة انها تتعب مع التمرين الا لما العب لها تمارين مقاومة الأول. هذي التمارين تعتبر تمارين  تشغيل  للارداف. عضلات الارداف مكونة من اكثر من نوع ألياف عشان كذا ما تتعب بسرعة و بالتالي ما تكبر ولا تتمو مثل بعض العضلات المحيطة.

ارفعي عدد الجولات او اختاري مطاط اقسى لو تبغي تلعبي هذي التمارين ك جلسة ارداف كاملة و مو بس تشغيل.

Now that summer is officially over the cold weather and the dark nights creeping in it’s so much easier to give up on your goals. But when January comes around you’ll be wishing you hadn’t fell off the wagon quite so much. 

Here are my top tips on staying accountable

1. Prepare your meals and track your calories   allowing extra for them celebrations getting dished out at work   

2. Always pack your gym or training kit if your out for the day it will stop you from having to go back home and increase the chances of choosing a Netflix binge instead. 

3. If you do mess up don’t give up because you’ve had 1 off day get back after it

2351,jamesgshore,influencers,"Serious FOMO   everyone wants to get back abroad after such a tough year with lockdowns and restrictions…

But most of us don’t have scores of money to pay for tests especially if you’re a family trying to go away on holiday. I don’t think I’m the only one who feels the government should remove VAT from the tests we are made to have in order to travel  

If you agree  let’s try and do something about it by signing the petition  I’ve added a swipe up on my story now    takeaholidayfromvat 

Please also Give Avi a follow as he has been behind this campaign to stop us all getting ripped off for tests and pushing to get the UK back to normality  I hope in a not too distant future we can get back to holidaying with our loved ones without the stress and financial pressure so many are under just to enjoy life again

2352,jamesgshore,influencers,"It’s pretty clear my biggest passion is health and fitness but that doesn’t mean you can’t still go out and enjoy yourself  

I’ve proven this over the years to say the least   Many ask how do I do it  

At the end of the day life is short and I’m all for having fun   making memories  Seeing friends/ family and majority of the time this includes alcohol or meals out or both  

Instead of worrying about feeling like you’ve fallen off the wagon when you’ve been out drank too much or ate something that’s made you feel guilty and throwing in the towel and quitting > Plan your social time into your goals and find a good balance that works for you and your goals  

You’ll find it will make things a lot easier to stick to than being so hard on yourself 100  of the time.  For me I know if I’ve had a solid week of training and eating well I can afford to have some much needed time off. It’s a win/win.

I had an amazing catch up with friends last weekend for freedom day  was nice to be back out socialising and having a few drinks to celebrate  

This weekend I opted for a more chilled one  long walks in the fresh air. Visualising   setting goals and working on my long term plans for the future 

It’s important to find balance in life  it will be a struggle at first when you start something new. But with time and planning you can find what works best for you.

A big part of my online coaching is working with my clients and finding that balance  not feeling like you’re on a constant diet. Being too restrictive and hard on yourself… because let’s face it this isn’t sustainable and you’re likely to fall off the wagon and beat yourself up about it.

2395,jamesgshore,influencers,How long we thinking this lockdowns lasting then 
2396,jamesgshore,influencers,"Constantly getting asked what I eat on an average day 

I tend to vary from day to day to keep it interesting I also give my clients 6 options per meal to choose between on their plans  

Atm Im trying to stay in a slight calorie deficit and averaging around 2500- 2600kcals per day 

Meal 1 
Over night oats 
 Oats  natural yoghurt  almond milk  frozen berries 
1.5 scoops protein 

Meal 2 
Turkey bacon and egg bagel 
Black Coffee 
I usually have this meal around 10 30 whilst doing client work. 

Meal 3 
Peri peri chicken 
Jasmin rice 
Mixed vegetables 

Post workout I have a shake 
Protein isolate 
Carbx
Creatine 

Meal 4 
Salmon 
Sweet potato mash 
Asparagus 
I mix between sweet and normal potato daily. 

Nighttime snack 
Grenade bar 
Satisfies the cravings and I tend to get mine later at night. I don’t eat these ever day tho. 

I also get asked what supplements are needed to get in shape. The truth is you don’t need supplements you can get everything you need from eating a varied nutritious diet. 
I simply add in a few supplements like protein to help reach my protein target for the day easier and to support my goals. And The protein bar is almost like a treat but I don’t eat them everyday .

I highly DONT recommend “diets” telling you to skip meals and have meal replacement shakes and teas and juices  this is purely marketing and for them to make money.  

Firstly focus on hitting your calories and macros for the day/week and getting into a good routine.

Head over and follow my fitness page  jamestindalefitness where I will be uploading a lot more helpful content

2507,jamessmithpt,influencers,"I’ve struggled with my weight every single day I can remember as a human being.

Whenever I’m leaner I’m fighting temptations and whenever I’m thicker I’m fighting for my self esteem. 

I thought for years struggling with my weight meant I couldn’t help people who struggle with theirs but it turned out the opposite. 

I know every craving  every emotion and almost every hurdle people go through as I battle them myself daily. 

I’m fortunate to love training and have a good understanding of nutrition. 

I’m more like my clients than I am like traditional personal trainers and I think people need to realise being in shape is like running your own business. 

You’re always going to face good times  bad times and ultimately you’re going to need to work at it every day.

 If I didn’t work for a month my business would go under. You gotta turn up daily to stay afloat in the training world too. 

In primary school I’d ask the canteen ladies what was ‘fattening’ at the age of 8 years old so I’ve been battling this for quite some time. 

I hate being hungry  food makes me happy and I don’t like finishing dinner unless I feel 120  full and slightly sick.  

If you need your PT to have a 6pack then you best train with someone else  

I do my best whilst living the good life  that’s what ultimately we should all be doing. 

So yeah  struggled with my weight long enough to educate all the people I’m 20 years ahead of.

2  Diet   Exercise  we don’t need to be perfect but we do need to DO OUR BEST. Once you’re doing that  what else can you do  

You may have played sport when you were younger  tried your hardest but you didn’t get depressed when you didn’t play premiership. 

So why not apply the same logic to life  Do your best and fucking enjoy it. 

Accept other people’s flaws and accept your own then fucking hell we can get on enjoying the tiny period of time we have on this spinning rock.

2640,jamessmithpt,influencers,"I love this question. 

So  my answer is… “enough.”

This makes me wealthier than people who have more money than me  paradoxically. 

Because if you earn more money than me but you haven’t quenched your thirst for needing more money  that’s still dissatisfaction. 

To earn what feels “enough” is ultimately the goal  No  

I never set out to be entrepreneurial  I just wanted a life I liked living. It’s one of many reasons I don’t do paid posts. 

I’ve trained incredibly wealthy people who can’t understand why people with less money can be more fulfilled than them.

2644,jamessmithpt,influencers,"5 years ago today  after packing up my UK PT business I set sail to become a PT in Australia.

Turns out the personal training scene here was a LOT MORE COMPETITIVE than I realised  my business never really took off the ground in Fitness First.

I took a tripod  an iPhone  a laptop and a whiteboard - I went home and threw the kitchen sink at building an online academy where I could teach people what they needed to know without competing with 32  quite egotistical  personal trainers in same building. 

5 years on and my ambitions to work from a local cafe near the beach have… well… got quite carried away. 

A massive thank you for the support and fuck me sideways do I have a big announcement for you in about 12 hours.

2646,jamessmithpt,influencers,"I’m not a massive believer in luck. An old rugby team mate for University who kicked for goal once said something to me which I’ll never forget. 

“The more you practice Jimbo  the luckier you’ll get.”

That’s to me what the majority of excellence is  reps. 

So many people label themselves as unable to do something when the reality is they’re unable to see the true reality  if they practice more they’ll climb higher and higher on the competence scale. 

“Do anything for 3 years and you’ll be good at it.”

It’s why many people work jobs they don’t like. They did it for ‘just a few years until…’ … until they mistake passion with being good at things. 

Most things you’d consider me good at I once fucking sucked at. 

I couldn’t skateboard  public speak  edit a video  speak to camera or even skateboard until I was 27. I hadn’t ever even done Jiu Jitsu at 27 before. 

I’m now 32  what happened  it’s not luck  it’s reps. 

14 466 is the number of videos I’ve posted to facebook since I began as a PT.

Don’t try to be lucky  try to get busy doing the reps. 

So from the bottom of my heart…Fuck your luck.  All the best.

IT WOULD BE THE WORST THING POSSIBLE. 

i  deaths would be worse  you’d expect your loved ones and family to live forever. If they died in a car crash it’d make the pain much worse

ii  what makes life amazing is the morbid reality at any moment you could eat your last meal out  watch a film for the last time or even hug someone for the last time. 

No one is ever promised the next day  everyone on the planet who dies today woke up thinking they’d see tomorrow. 

Most people who gets diagnosed with cancer today didn’t see it coming when they planned out 2022. No one saw the pandemic coming - the fact we don’t live forever is what makes it great. 

I’m a big believer in this  

When someone asks you ‘what would you do on your last day on earth ’ 

If your plans for that day don’t closely resemble your daily life you live now  there’s some work to be done. 

Life isn’t about living the longest or dying with the most money  it’s about making it the best version of it possible before the lights go out.

2685,jamessmithpt,influencers,"Ladies  let’s get this straight… 

There are 3 things 

1  Your Structure  hip to femur ratio which will determine if you are preferential to have a thigh gap or not. Shoulder to waist ratio  height  hip dips etc. THESE CAN NOT BE CHANGED - So 100  should not be worried about. 

2  Body Fat  this can be altered through periods of dieting and often followed by periods of relaxing. It’s very normal to cycle up and down a few kg’s every few months. 

3  Muscle Mass  muscle is very difficult to obtain  progress is depressingly slow for men   women. When you stop training a muscle you’ll begin losing it within 2-3 weeks. You could work a year to build something that could be lost in weeks. 

i  ‘Bulky’… if you think standing up with weights will make you bulky. What are you implying  That you’ll gain months worth of muscle everywhere because you started a standing movement in the gym  

IF THERE is too much fat when you look in the mirror  reduce calories with a sensible deficit over time. 

IF THERE IS TOO MUCH MUSCLE  literally said no one ever  then reduce reduce training volume across your weeks. If your shoulders for instance are becoming ‘too developed’ shave some sets off delts and give them to a lagging body part like glutes. 

IF YOUR STRUCTURE IS UPSETTING YOU  then have a fucking word with yourself. 

Confidence stems from your ability to own what you have  not persistently worrying about what you don’t… find me a productive value from being self-critical about something you can’t influence 

MONTHS  maybe even years dictate how your physique looks… so please don’t wake up thinking because you added a variant of standing up under load to your programme that you’ll wake up as Bulk Hogan. 

James 

P.s To this day I’ve never seen a natural female athlete who I would EVER deem as ‘bulky’ - some insecure dudes probably just jealous there are girls who can out lift them. 

Ladies. Don’t let some insecure bro gaslight you from being strong. The benefits of BEING STRONG stay with you outside the gym and become a part of your persona. 

Keep lifting heavy shit."

2688,jamessmithpt,influencers,“Gonna run a marathon this year  innit.” 
2689,jamessmithpt,influencers,"GVT   German Volume Training which is 10 sets of 10 reps - I’ve often copped a bit of shit for mocking it in training plans.

FOR ME  it’s too many sets. Parkinson’s Law states  work expands so as to fill the time available for its completion. 

So if you give an exercise 10x sets to get something done  it will take 10x sets. 

Studies have also shown that 10x sets is no superior to 5x sets. “Findings suggest performing >5 sets per exercise does not promote greater gains in muscle strength and hypertrophy.”  Daniel A Hackett et al. Sports  Basel . 2018.  p.s thanks  bdccarpenter for sending me that. 

I feel the same about 9-5 office jobs  most people spread 3 hours work across 7 hours to keep the status quo. 

There’s even a method called HIT training where you allocate 1x set to an exercise per workout and go balls deep on that 1x set and you’d be surprised at the ‘gains’ people get from 1x set done properly. 

Moral of the story  it’s the work you put into the reps and the sets  not just the number of sets you do that promote muscle growth and strength increases. 

WHATEVER AMOUNT OF TIME YOU ALLOCATE TO A TASK  IT WILL USUALLY TAKE THAT LONG TO COMPLETE. 

Work harder  not longer.

2693,jamessmithpt,influencers,CSGB - Starvation Mode vs Adaptive Thermogenesis 
2694,jamessmithpt,influencers,"No  not even close. 

If it did we’d see people in starvation studies look vastly different. 

Prisoners of war would even get love handles if this hypothesis had any merit. 

It’s the same theory in saying  don’t spend too much money or you’ll have more in your account at the end of the day. 

Eating far too low in a deficit has trade offs to mood  performance  muscle loss and even losing your period in some cases. 

But all in all this probably stems from a lie told to a client to stop them from going too far in a deficit. 

“Sheila don’t go too low on calories or… you’ll… gain fat.”

I’m sure the intention was intended for good but  no  starvation mode is about legit as the morals of the staff at No. 10 Downing Street. 

Sensible deficits for the win. Find me someone who starved themselves and gained weight and I’ll do a courtney black HIIT workout live to the nation. 

All the best

This year we have loved ‘A boy called Christmas’ on Sky Cinema a heartwarming family movie with a new twist on the Christmas story. And ‘Rob and Romesh vs 2021 A Christmas Special’ on Sky Max.

Now we can get Sky  Netflix  Disney   All 4  Spotify to name a few  all side by side with a simple voice command.

We designed our wedding rings with  thediamondstoreuk   they were so great to deal with  amazing service   product. A good friend  josephterterian came from dubai to sing opera throughout the evening   he was superb as always. Joe also sang ‘Nessun Dorma’ whilst we   our guests released balloons into the sky for all our loved ones no longer with us  thank you for being so wonderful joe.  thefunctionband were our wedding band   we couldn’t have wished for better entertainment. From their amazing outfit changes  to their constant medley’s of songs   to their dance routines  they were absolutely phenomenal   I can’t speak higher of them. Thank you Dan for being so wonderful to deal with   you really did make our day so special. We had pics of bella   cooper on female/male desserts as a personal touch  aswell as personalised poems for every single guest on the back of their menus that we created with  worditrhyme   they certainly did not disappoint. We had a table of photos of our loved ones who have passed too that the lovely  memoryeditsbykeena created beautifully.  alagoevents were our wedding planners   they captured our vision so well. It’s the little details i love bringing to things   hopefully they all paid off. 2021 was the year we made our love official so it will always be so special to us

3183,jesswright77,influencers,"Pregnancy - It certainly is a rollercoaster   that’s the best way to describe it  I’m scared  excited  grateful  vulnerable   quite frankly totally   utterly overwhelmed at not even knowing what to expect  I promise to share this journey  but the good   the bad as much as I can  and I love to hear from you girls too because ultimately it can feel like we’re doing it alone a lot of the time as I guess we are  but at least we have each other too to confide in   share common feelings   experiences  

I also wanted to acknowledge the following  since announcing that we are expecting our baby. My heart goes out to anyone that this was a trigger for. In the past few years my world has been opened up to the realm of fertility   all the struggles that can come with it. 

Be it  close friends or friends of friends etc  I have seen the struggles to conceive   the sad loss of babies   a whole world really that consumes your every day as a woman. I am eternally grateful as I have already said for this blessing    I want to make it clear we do not take it for granted   also send huge love to any ladies    men out there that have not had an easy ride  as I know there are so so many of you. 

I still spend every day hoping this baby is fine   that we will be ok   even then that my baby is healthy   lives a full life  I promise it’s never ending. And behind the lovely glowing Instagram posts there is also a hell of a lot of emotions  hormones   worry that you do not see. Not to mention my random mood changes whereby one minute Im feeling amazing   then others where I’m sure if someone  usually will  breathes a certain way  I could turn into a crazed woman possessed . 

Anyway here’s a shot of me in one of my good moods despite the expression   soaking up every second of this holiday  sending lots of love on this Saturday morning x x"

3303,katiepiper_,influencers,"With so many sudden changes to my face at a young age  my hair became a big part of my identity. It’s not about vanity  it’s about when other parts of my face couldn’t move or were Incased in a mask this was my way to communicate with the world. 

My hair as I knew it was temporarily taken from me. Areas of my scalp were burnt  lots of my hair fell out and some bits were shaved off in theatre.
My hair doesn’t wear me  I wear it. A good hair day for me is when I own my appearance and exude genuine confidence. What society deems as beautiful is slowly changing. You don’t need to feel good all of the time  you don’t need to feel beautiful everyday. I aim for body/face neutrality  feeling ok or feeling neutral with one’s appearance is a powerful place to be. 

I’m comfortable with how I look. Some days I feel glamorous and beautiful other days I can feel ashamed and the odd one out. But I know the markings  the visible differences on me they show the public a new normal  as I’m seen on tv each  every part of me and they show the real me. 
Change is good. Seeing representation from all walks on life helps us all.

I’m proud to work with  panteneuk as their ambassador a team that celebrates the real me.

To create this look we used  PanteneUK Silky   Glowing shampoo and Glowing Intense hair mask and the Never Stray No Crunch hair spray   Weightless Oil Mist

These are just a few amazing ladies that have worked with my charity over the years and I know from my own experience how daunting it can be to reenter the world after trauma  so educating people on the importance of being conscious of their actions around those with visible difference can make such a massive change in recovery."
3309,katiepiper_,influencers," I am so happy to read about  officialjakedaniels    BlackpoolFC  AdidasFootball player coming out as gay and at the age of 17  In an industry that is often known for toxic masculinity  I applaud his courage for owning his true self and hopefully pave the way to show other players and people that look up to him  that if he can do it  then they can too.

I know that this will be an amazing step in the world of football  but I really hope one day we will reach a point where children no longer feel the need to ‘come out’  being a member of the LGBTQ  community is not a choice. For now  we should feel privileged by the members of this community  for sharing their true selves in a society that often rejects them.

Adele recently shared the struggle with her hands as a side effect of chemo  saying ‘The pain comes in waves. Night times are THE WORST.

3340,katiepiper_,influencers,"Todays  MindsetMonday comes from  PatchProblems 

“Hi all  my name is Dean Boyle and I have a condition called Alopecia. For those who aren t aware  alopecia is a condition where your body s immune system attacks itself causing inflammation which then attacks the hair follicles. There are many types of alopecia  mine falls under Areata. 

I first experienced hair loss when I was ten. My first patch lasted for a few months until it completely disappeared. Over the next fifteen years these patches would come and go. When I was a teenager my alopecia became something bullies would target. I was ridiculed over my patches and I was made to believe that I wasn t like everyone else.

Having my patches come and go caused a lot of anxiety. I knew when my hair returned that it would only be a matter of time before it would go again. I went to see my doctor many times. They would always pass it off as being stress. I had many appointments with the dermatologist and I tried many creams and treatments but none of it worked. As I got older I wanted answers but got none.

In 2019 my hair completely fell out this time. Nothing prepared me for this. It didn t stop with just the top of my head  I started to lose my eyebrows  eyelashes  my arm hair  chest hair  before I knew it I d lost my entire body hair. All of a sudden I no longer recognised my reflection. I had a major identity crisis. Unless you ve been there  you wouldn t be able to understand. I didn t just lose my hair  I lost my confidence and my identity. The emotional distress of losing hair is sadly something that falls under the radar.

Lucky enough for me I stumbled across a alopecia support group on facebook. I was now surrounded by people who are experiencing the same or something similar to me. This then led to me finally being confident enough to start my own account on Instagram where I talk about alopecia and my own experiences of it. When I was younger  there wasn t any role models and social media didn t exist. I want to be that person I wish I had when I first started to lose my hair. I just hope that by sharing my own experience of hair loss it will help others in dealing with theirs” "

3344,katiepiper_,influencers,"AD I recently took part in a study with  asicsrunning to measure the impact stopping exercise for a week had on the mind.

Fitness has always been so important to me  to keep my mind and body feeling healthy - I use working out as a way to relieve stress  and refocus before or after a busy day - so I found the week off challenging to say the least. 

The study revealed that not exercising for a week has the same mental impact as one week of broken sleep on our State of Mind  resulted in a 23  increase in racing thoughts. Our confidence levels dropped by 20   energy levels by 23   and our ability to cope with stress fell by 22  and those were definitely some of the symptoms I noticed within myself.

My advice to mums is to take the picture  All too often we don’t want to be in pictures with our kids because we look fat/tired/no make up etc. It takes me 2 hours of corrective make up and hair to look what society deems “normal”.

3371,katiepiper_,influencers,"Todays  MindsetMonday comes from  acelizabeth TRIGGER WARNING  graphic images. 

My name is Ashleigh and I am 28yrs old. Last year I was meant to have my ‘best’ year  I bought my flat  I was starting a new job  had new car and was planning on having the best summer yet. Then in a flash  it all changed….

I was enjoying my first night out once restrictions had eased in a pub in Sudbury where someone decided to spray ethanol onto an open flame  not once  but twice. The flame tracked up the can and exploded into a fireball  pushing forward setting my cousin and I on fire . It all happened so fast. 

As an A E nurse for the NHS  I know the best thing to do in that situation is stop  drop and roll - that’s exactly what I done. It happened in a blur. I was rushed to hospital  ventilated and sent to intensive care for 2 days. In hospital in total for 14 days  experiencing multiple procedures and skin grafts. 

It has been a long road to get to where I am now but now I can look at myself in the mirror and accept my reflection.

5 weeks post injury I was back in the gym  7 weeks post injury I started a brand new job.. and the rest has been from there. Everyday is not easy but everyday is a step forward in the right direction. 
I lived by the motto ‘the scars will always look better tomorrow’. 

Yes I was burnt  yes I still have injuries to deal with but my burn does not define me as a person  it’s a part of me. I’m also a nurse  fitness lover  friend  sister  daughter among more.

I am Ashleigh with a burn  not Ashleigh the victim "

3383,katiepiper_,influencers,"Todays  MindsetMonday is one I’ve chosen to feature of my fellow  PanteneUK ambassador and an amazing that young lady that shows that a lack of eyesight  doesn’t mean a lack of vision  the incredible  lucyedwardsofficial  

BBC broadcaster and disability activist Lucy Edwards has gained 136k followers on Instagram  1.7 million followers on TikTok and more than 400 000 subscribers to her YouTube channel. Lucy started posting in 2015  however it wasn t until 2021 that she shared her first parody video to educate people about how blind people navigate their daily lives.

Lucy has explained “I love beauty  I love looking good  but there is an assumption that because I can’t see  I don’t care. But of course  it is still important to me how I feel [that] I look”.

I wanted to feature Lucy as I feel like she is once again breaking boundaries when it comes to beauty. Beauty is not purely visual  it’s a feeling  an emotion and a touch. Plus it doesn’t have just one vision or boundary  beauty is for everyone and I was so proud to hear her name when my Pantene family announced her as an ambassador."
3384,katiepiper_,influencers,What a Sunday  I really love the ones where we all just spend some time doing random things as a family  we spent the afternoon creating painting mayhem in the kitchen followed by some movies and some sticker books before bed  and I’ve had a  panteneuk hair mask in all day ready for a big week  so excuse the scrunchie    ambassador

Today I had another  inmodeuk Morpheus8 treatment  a fractional device with programmable penetration depth and energy delivery for treatment of fine lines   wrinkles  acne scars  and general skin tone. The 24 coated pins penetrate into the subdermal tissue  coagulating the fat and contracting connective tissue. Simultaneously  directional RF energy generates bulk sub-necrotic heating in the dermis 

I’ve been finding really effective in evening the colour of my skin graft  softening the skin and improving the elasticity in the grafted areas. I also like how little down time is involved  I go make up free for next day and ensure I always protect my face with factor 50 SPF.

3396,katiepiper_,influencers,"Todays  MindsetMonday comes from  zaralenajackson  

 Hello  my name is Zaralena Jackson  I’m 29 years old and I live with a condition called Alopecia. In July 2020 my hair fell from my head  face and body with no cause. Within just 6 weeks my identity was stripped from me. I had no prior Hairloss or family history of this condition. Due to Hairloss being classed as cosmetic  I have struggled to get answers and just been dismissed with being told “stress” is likely my cause. I have pushed for every aspect of my health to be checked  and so far all my blood work is being classed as “clear”. For those who don’t know  Alopecia is a condition where your body’s immune system attacks itself causing inflammation which attacks the hair follicles. There are different types of Alopecia  some more  some less severe. Unfortunately for me my alopecia is the most severe diagnosis possible leaving me totally hairless.

1 year 5 months later I have started to adapt to my new image. Which hasn’t been an easy journey. Hairloss is cruel  and you have no idea how important hair can be until you don’t have it. It’s now my priority to do whatever I can for anyone else suffering Hairloss  wether for reasons due to chemotherapy or Alopecia like myself. I have launched my own cosmetics range  Zaralenacosmetics  giving a solution to those losing facial hair like myself  and I often post bald to show with or without hair you can still be confident in your own skin. My next step in my journey is to start on a treatment called The JAK inhibitor. I am hopeful that sharing my Hairloss journey will help give others hope and guidance on how to deal with theirs.  "

3402,katiepiper_,influencers,"Todays  MindsetMonday comes from  Char.CrohnsftWilson  

“My name is Charlotte  I am 30 years old and I live with a permanent Stoma bag. 
When I was 18  I was diagnosed with Crohn’s disease after a few years of investigations. Crohn’s effects everyone slightly differently but for me  this meant weight loss  frequent toilet trips  diarrhoea  loss of blood and as time went on  more and more pain. Over the past 12 years  I have spent a lot of time on steroids as well as trying all sorts of medications and IV treatments with horrible side effects and the worst thing for me was not really knowing if they are working  Finally last year  enough was enough and I had got to a point where my quality of life was so poor. My Crohn’s disease had really taken control of my life. I have a 7-year-old and an amazing family/friend network and I was missing out on so many things which was also really emotionally difficult.

For me  most of my severe inflammation with my Crohn’s was isolated to my large bowel with lots of narrowing – so hearing the words from my consultant at an appointment - ‘having this operation could potentially be a cure for you’ was all I needed to hear to go ahead with a subtotal colectomy with end ileostomy- in other words removal of my large bowel/colon with the end of the small bowel then brought out through the abdomen and stitched on to the tummy. This then drains the waste/poo from the bowel into a bag on my tum.

Fatima is a comedian  model and content creator  making waves in the industry about the treatment of people with disabilities. Fatima has achondroplasia  a form of dwarfism that has restricted her growth  and she has had her fair share of negativity from others over her 24 years and which she still gets today. 

In Fatima’s words  she now has an “invisible shield” and has found comedy and modelling to be some of her favourite things to do. She has been part of BBC Three’s “Laugh Lessons”  where some of the best new comedians on the scene tell their story through sketches about their modern life  and more recently you may have seen her on Celebrity Gogglebox as part of Channel 4’s Black to Front Project  part of the channel’s commitment to improve black representation. 

Fatima is passionate  funny and here to make a change and the pair talk about Fatima’s life growing up  changing how you feel inside and how we all have something to offer the world. An extraordinary person indeed

Today marks 15 years that Tony has been clean and sober after nearly dying from addiction. Tony has been very public about his journey with substance abuse  saying ‘I’ve spent over a million pounds on drugs  lost houses  record deals and none of it meant anything to me  the only thing that meant anything to me was drugs’. 

Today he writes ‘I post these pictures as a message that when you think that life can’t get any worse  it can only get better  never take anything for granted and never ever give up’. Tony joined my on my podcast in July 2020  where we spoke in great detail about the path that led to addiction and his incredible road to recovery  so I wanted to feature him here today as an inspiration to those dealing with addiction or that have friends of family that are struggling with addiction  as he is a true example of not only how your life can be turned around but that the road is always as easy as people think.

3415,katiepiper_,influencers,"WOW  Katie ‘Kate’ Piper OBE. This is without a doubt one of the happiest days of my life 

I am so honoured to be recognised on the Queen’s New Years Honours List for Services To Charity   Burns Survivors.

My charity -  kpfoundation has been my life’s work. It’s now into its second decade   I’m very proud to say we’ve actively assisted   rehabilitated thousands of burns survivors with both their physical and mental recovery. For those who don’t know  we also launched   founded the UK’s only burns rehabilitation centre after I had to go to France for my treatment all those years ago. 

The reality is - this was all born out of being touched by evil  trauma   darkness. That said  I was deeply inspired   had a fierce determination to change things for the future   make a more positive impact on the world. There was no doubt - I just had to change things for those with burns  scars   disfigurements. 

My doctor  drmohammadajawad   my parents were there at the start of my journey. They’ve encouraged me every step of the way   were crucial support in the KPF early days when I was still very much recovering.

This honour    the charity is in my name but we are a team. A unit of staff  volunteers  trustees   our incredible survivors who are at the heart of everything we do. So to them I must say thank you  thank you  thank you.

Thank you to my team  freshpartners  bellepr   charlottebelletobinpr for how hard you work for me behind the scenes. You have supported my career for so many years   have empowered me with the KPF   all of my charity projects. 

This OBE is all of US.

My story is one of survival. But importantly it’s also a story of hope  positivity  and how light can truly overcome darkness. 

This is a very special day for my family  team and I. Thank you for following me  supporting me and joining my life’s journey. I’m off to have some fizz  celebrations and a little cry

At the age of 20  Lucy was studying criminology at the University of Leicester when she began experiencing head pain that just wouldn’t go away and  as we now know  would change her life forever. Due to her symptoms  in 2016  Lucy was misdiagnosed with a breakdown and sectioned for three and a half months in a psychiatric centre  and the pain didn’t stop there for Lucy. After failures from the professionals looking after her  Lucy was left paralysed on her left leg below the knee.

This is Renie’s story  ”The drawing is about the shame that I carried because I was a victim of domestic abuse. I felt shame because I was powerless to do anything about what was happening to me because I lived in fear of my perpetrator. At the time I did this drawing  I purposely covered my face because I still carried the shame and did not want to show my face. I was screaming inside and the only way I could communicate what had happened to me was to write the words ‘I did not consent’. I wrote the words in red because the colour represents  justified  anger."

Submitted by  the nicu mummy

‘My eldest son was born in 2017  with 2 lesions on his left lung. We had a month long stay in NICU  newborn intensive care unit   both at our local hospital and Great Ormond Street. GOSH operated on him at 19 days old. 

Going through NICU with my son was the toughest experience of my life so far. It took me a long time to come to terms with what happened  and it was only after the birth of my second son last April  that I really began to accept what happened. 

NICU experiences can vary in length and can affect parents in different ways  regardless of how long their little one was in NICU for. There is an online community of NICU parents  which I have found since starting my blog  and it’s been great to connect with them and feel less alone in my own experience’"

“Hi Katie  I am a disabled model  I am 25 and live in Lincolnshire.

When I was 20  I suffered from a rare brain disease named anti NDMA receptor autoimmune encephalitis which is the result of inflammation of the brain. 
Unfortunately  this was misdiagnosed as being a mental breakdown and thus I was placed in a psychiatric ward for three months   the brain disease was able to progress and ultimately left me extremely close to death. 
Further complications led to me having 3 rounds of ECT on my 21st birthday as a last ditch attempt to bring me round. These triggered seizures  but ultimately reset my brain. 
However  my body was still catatonic and I went to have such a large seizure that I fell out of my psych ward bed onto an open radiator pipe which- as I couldn’t feel anything - ultimately burnt entirely through my sciatic nerve and permanently paralysed my lower left leg. 

Upon being discharged from hospital  I had zero memory  didn’t recognise my family. Couldn’t walk  couldn’t talk or anything. For the next two years  I had to relearn everything from scratch. Including now learning to live with both and invisible disability - my acquired brain injury and also a visible disability - the paralysis. 

These were the darkest times of my life but by some miracle and no end of hard work and determination  once these two years had passed  I managed to return to university and complete my degree  getting a 2 1 in criminology and since this  whilst I continue my journey to recovery  I put all of my energy into raising awareness of encephalitis and also increasing the visibility of disability in fashion and the media to help normalise disabled bodies”"

On mental health day I want to highlight that non of us are immune  it doesn’t discriminate. We can all find ourselves in a place one day that we felt was so far from our regular life.

They’re a way to teach my children about resilience and strength and they’re the reason I’ve been able to connect and help so many people that struggle with their own.

I love travelling and going away  even if it disrupts routine  I usually can adjust it to it and still keep on the same path. This last trip I definitely haven’t been able to  so I booked a early flight home. Literally just alcohol and bad food here  like putting a vegan in a butchers and saying crack on  I showed up to celebrate with my friends and we had a lot of fun  also important  although I’m a bi advocate of enjoying the process   I love pushing myself and leading the lifestlye I do  but I’d not be true to myself   values for my current situation by staying - point is  some people may not understand but sometimes you gotta put yourself first.

3523,korisampson,influencers,"For a bit more clarity on todays story ramble  Perception is key to your mindset. Don’t tell yourself you have to do something  tell yourself you get to do something. It you’re lucky enough to have the time to invest in yourself  even though some people are reluctant to or make excuses  you have enough money to access a gym  and able body enough to use it to grow and to run and lift weights then you should be happy to go and do these things. 

This translates to many aspects of life but if you can navigate with this mindset you will be happy. Show gratitude for what you have  don’t waste the opportunities you are given   let yourself down by not working on yourself to get better. 

There’s two sides of this however. I have this perspective but for me it’s none negotiable. I enjoy what I do  pushing myself in all aspects brings me joy  I love the struggle but I also know to keep being better then myself   to reach the goals I want I personally have to be relentless in going for them. That means I do have to do it  but I also get to do it."

Let’s talk setting systems over setting goals  Find out the environment that you thrive in  then create it. You’ll do this by creating habits  surrounding yourself with the right people  making it easy to manoeuvre “goals” and to compound results in your life - see last photo

For me I don’t actually write down small short term goals  making yourself accountable in reaching them is important but I think putting a time scale on them is almost discouraging more then anything. 

I personally set out a list before the start of the year of goals to reach  and order them in the likelihood of when They’ll be ticked off. Some will be easier and some probably unachievable actually  will follow onto this shortly  I do set myself small wins that I can reach daily or weekly for example

Find out what you actually want   where you want to go before figuring out how to get there - establish a why - then a how - then a SYSTEM. 

Like I said some long term goals you set you may not hit  if you aim for the “sky” you may not quite reach but you’ll go higher then if you don’t try to get off the ground at all. 

Sometimes you also need courage to set and meet these goals you’re thinking about. Don’t get in your own way  maybe it’s the fear of failure or the many reasons why you shouldn’t that you don’t even start. Fear is the thing that gets in the way of what we can be and where we are.. 

You have to push yourself out of that comfort zone to get what you want from life. Here’s where these pictures make sense to me  I hate heights. I wouldn’t even go on a rollercoaster until last year. So I jumped out of a plane.  This was more of mental challenge for me  one of a few I have written to achieve this year. 

Some goals are easily measurable such as jumping out of a plane others not. for example I want to “be more giving” so to achieve this I do daily wins  part of the 50 day challenge I’m doing is do a act of kindness or giving every day. I also set a measurable goal to run the london marathon for charity.

Lastly remember they are goals and not laws. 

Anyway another goal ticket off this year already. Swipe to see before and after "

Progress isn’t linear. Even in the constant battle of you vs you we all go through  should go through to improve ourselves  Remember things change  circumstances  goals  your whole life can. Don’t judge yourself when reflecting. 

I’m no where near as big  strong or ripped  not far off  as I was when I was bodybuilding. I lost it all over a year when I stopped  I still trained but my whole lifestyle changed. I spend two years partying instead pretty much lost sight of a lot of stuff. However I wouldn’t even want to look and live like that now. 

I’m fit  healthy and In great shape  not blowing my own trumpet-clap for yourself  but now I don’t just work on my body in the gym I work on my mind   my spirit also. 

Like I said don’t judge yourself too much. Bodybuilding taught me loads about my self  self discipline   the ability to be relentlessly obsessed with something. 

Everyone finds their way at different times   we’re all in our own lane. Just find the right direction and start moving towards it "

3599,korisampson,influencers,Sun is shining so here’s the first selfie of 2022  - something I read today “The direction you’re heading in is far more important then how fast you move. Pick the right direction and start walking.”
3600,korisampson,influencers,"So I’m gonna be real with you if you think asking someone else where they get there motivation from or advice on how to stay motivated is gonna motivate you  then maybe what it is you want isn’t right for you. It’s one of my biggest asked questions  Here’s something to think about.

A habit is said to come from 60 days of doing something day in day out. At some point in the first 30 days it’s really gonna trip you up  you’re gonna be asking why am I doing this. can I carry on  Maybe il have another day off today  I’ve already done 3 days this week so that’s enough.
But research also shows that in around 18 months you can make a habit last a lifetime.

This is where you need to really have a word with yourself and ask your self how much you want something in order to get there.

So what you really need  isn’t motivation. It’s self discipline. To maintain these choices and make them a habit. Then it becomes autopilot and you can invest your energy into making more positive changes. 

This is why I suggest joining me on my wake up and move - 50 day challenge."

My advice to you is if you want to start training or just get back into your old routine and eat a healthier more nutritious diet than you may have been the last few weeks. Make sure you pick a realistic diet and by diet I just mean the food you consume daily not restricting yourself with an extreme fad diet. 
For me that’s making sure I have a wide variety of colour on my plate as it has been looking a little beige the last few weeks  and I find the perfect balance for me  That means cake  chocolate  pizza  pasta  bread etc is always allowed even in January  I never restrict any food groups I just focus on variety   balanced meals that I love to eat   makes me feel good. 

Find a fitness routine that is realistic to your lifestyle   schedule and something you enjoy. Not just a trend that you jump on that you actually absolutely hate doing because let’s face it if you hate doing something you’re not gonna be consistent   you’re not going to continue. 

For me it’s walking    resultswithbump strength   Pilates classes. That’s what I enjoy so that’s what I will consistently stick to all year not just for January.

Finding a healthy weekly routine of eating well   staying active should be a forever lifestyle change it’s not just for January  may   September 

 And yes I did sneeze   hit myself with the weight at the end "

“My Health   Happiness programme will be full of those types of workouts  an online food library of over 800 recipes  which trust me.. If I can cook them  you can   five minute meditations and talks from brilliant life coaches around mindset and wellbeing.

“We are your community and let’s do this all together.”

It felt like the right time. I have regular childcare in place for Roman   I’ve been working out regularly again which took a while to establish. Sure lots of busy mama’s can relate    

My workouts have changed though there shorter  lower intensity    I also focus more on the recovery of my mind   body.

 I can honestly say I’ve never felt more content with my body. I feel confident  strong and happy in myself which hasn’t always been the case I can assure you.

Some days  I want to keep it simple and minimal. But I also love to mix it up with some statement pieces when dressing up my outfits. I felt like trying a new combination  so I stacked the new Pandora I-D bangles  playing around with layers and the different metal tones. The  PandoraBangles look as good alone as they do together.

In 2020 our lives dramatically changed  We had to learn to adapt our lifestyles   our homes suddenly became our offices  gyms   beauty salons. As much as I found it frustrating at first I’ve actually kept a few of these changes. Including my hair removal. I have tried salons in the past but being honest with you I just don’t have the time as a busy working mum to keep it up  
 
I’ve been using the  braun global Silk-expert Pro 5 IPL for 4 weeks now and I’ve already started to notice a difference after using the product  just once a week. It only takes 5 minutes to do both legs so it so easy to fit in my day usually when Roman has gone to bed. 
 
I chose Braun IPL because it’s the safest  fastest and most efficient IPL   I use it on my terms

Turning eight is a real milestone for me and my business.

When we launched back in 2013 there wasn’t such a thing as “online fitness platforms” - everyone still had fitness DVD’s and diet books and I remember being scared of being the first to take that step and enter the unknown.

From the start  the reason for going solely online was because we wanted to reach as many people as possible and make health and fitness as affordable - and hassle free - as possible.

It has been quite a journey and we have learnt a lot along the way  but we have now helped thousands of people get healthier  happier and reach their goals.

I became a mum last year and it made me slow down my approach to fitness but it also made me appreciate  rwl even more.

Becoming a mum made me appreciate my body and I didn t get back to exercise properly for six months after having Roman. 

I didn t want to just  snap back  into shape  I wanted to respect my body and allow it time to heal.
And having RWL to support me with healthy recipes  mindset courses  gentle exercise and post pregnancy advice made me feel confident enough to take things slow.

WE ARE RWL

Real stories of health and fitness deserve to be seen - and at RWL we are all about sharing them

For the last 8 years we have been on a mission to show that health is for EVERYONE

Spreading the message that no person should feel they don’t fit in has been a key part of building our amazing community

No one should feel they don’t deserve a chance to improve their quality of life through healthier choices

 RWL research found that 92  of people do not feel represented in health and fitness marketing

With 43  saying they don’t see anyone their size in fitness images and 42  wishing they could see their level of ability represented

This month RWL celebrates it’s 8th anniversary and we couldn’t think of any better way to celebrate than to shine a light on our members  trainers and staff and their stories of what being healthy means to them

From mums and mums-to-be to 50-year-old personal trainers and 19-year-old students WE ARE RWL  and we want to shout it from the rooftops

3951,mac_griffiths_,influencers,"Why motivation is BS  

A lot of people crave motivation in order to maintain their gym attendance but in reality motivation is only the first step  it prompts you into taking action  as soon as you start motivation depletes and it depletes quickly. 

What I want you to understand is that yes it’s good to feel motivated but its discipline   habits that keep us as people in a routine  weather you know it or not we all have our own daily routine and we do it without thinking about it and that’s because it’s apart of our life. 

You can have all the motivation in the world to start your fitness journey or change your diet but if you don’t plan around your current daily habits you’ll never fit it in. 

Here’s how I see it  if you want change stop waiting around to feel motivated. Make a plan write it down with specific times and locations in line with your current routine   habits  that way you can see where you can begin to stack the new habit you want to introduce onto current habits in your life and make it easy for yourself. 

Now what do I mean by make it easy - well if you want to go the gym after work then take your gym stuff with you   train with a friend at that specific time  nobody wants to be that friend who bails on plans  the more you do this the more it becomes part of your everyday life and it becomes a new habit

3954,mac_griffiths_,influencers,"Why being consistent matters 

A lot of people start their fitness journey   typically get frustrated that there not seeing results straight away. Making changes to your life during your fitness journey takes time and effort  you first have to form new habits  that itself takes time and patience 

Our bodies adapt gradually to exercise so it’s important to have a structure in place in order to 
1  follow and 2  allow for growth 

When you first start something new you’re not expected to be a expert  you start as a beginner like everyone else and slowly you become better and more established at what you do and it’s the same with fitness you begin to understand your body better and what works for you. However if you’re on   off training all the time your body has no time to adapt. If you train like this I’m sure you’ll say you don’t feel motivated at times and that’s ok  it just mean that you have to find your ‘WHY’ - the real reason you made your fitness goals what they are  

Fitness is a form of self art  you wouldn’t rush an artist to create a masterpiece so why are you rushing yourself  just enjoy the process

3955,mac_griffiths_,influencers,"Let’s talk about abs  READ   SHARE this could save you some time

It s important to understand that when it comes to abs that we all have them  only difference is their prominence  what you consume on a daily basis  will have far more significance in helping you reveal your abs than all the ab work you do.

Now Ive said reveal as a lot of people would like to see some definition however this is not the same as wanting to building your abs  as wanting to build your abs would require you to train them  but there is a huge misconception that just training them in isolation  will miraculously emulsify the fat that hides them  it won t.

This is why I always encourage those seeking abs to be mindful of their body fat  evaluate your starting position  you may decide that your time could be better spent on exercises that burn more calories and lower your body fat  than doing a 1000 crunches."

But before we do just note this was filmed months ago  I’m currently sat in my office like a potato  

People often ask what’s the best cardio to do to burn fat  

My answer is simple - consume less calories 

Now I’ll be the first to admit cardio isn’t my favourite you ask me to run an I’ll say nah it’s not my thing anymore  

I believe when you think of doing cardio it must be something you enjoy or at least find comfortable   you have to ease yourself into it. I seen a lot of people jumping on the 5k hype at the start of lockdown in March an I’d like to know how many kept it up  Me personally I don’t like running I’ll happily skip or do pad work  granted I’m no boxer  but I enjoy it an I only started recently so get over the technique

Cool.

Now I’m not a fan of long captions because they’re annoying and generally a meaningless waste of time  but I’m writing one so it’d be sick if you read it. No worries if not though  it’s not like I spent 2 hours writing it. Oh wait…
 
I’ve been part of the fitness industry for over 10 years and I’ve seen an abundance of shitty fitness apps/resources with the most basic training programmes  rudimentary meal plans and zero guidance on how to actually MAKE PROGRESS. Believe me when I say this  the Morsia App is different. We’ve built an app that not only gives you customised training programmes   personalised meal plans but also  crucially  teaches you HOW to make progress and keep doing so. Too many of the apps/plans out there are short-term fixes - things which will help you for a bit but then leave you stuck and frequently in a worse place than when you started. The Morsia App is better than that. It’s designed to guide you through the process of building muscle or losing fat  or whatever your fitness goal is  but at the same time help you learn HOW.
 
Our training programmes aren’t just generic plans. They’re structured  periodised blocks which make it impossible for you NOT to hit your goals. Whether you’re a beginner or you’ve been training for years  we’ll build a plan to suit YOU. Then  once you’ve finished  we’ll tell you what to do next because we want you to make progress and CONTINUE to do so.
 
Our meal plans aren’t boring. We won’t ask you to eat chicken   broccoli every day. We’ll build you a varied diet plan full of awesome meals and if there’s anything you don’t like  just swap it for something you do 
 
Right  I’ve run out of caption space. The point is - the Morsia App is the greatest fitness app on the planet  it’s only gonna get better   it’s currently the cheapest it’s EVER been  so if you’re frustrated at not hitting your goals or just want to try something new  use the link in my bio   join the team.

4261,mattdoesfitness,influencers,When you’re desperately trying to keep it together despite being acutely aware that your training partner has significantly bigger delts than you 
4262,mattdoesfitness,influencers,Throwback to the boys on a mad one in Majorca 
4263,mattdoesfitness,influencers,"Can’t beat a sunny Tuesday morning in the garden with a nice pair of jeans and my trusty hoes 
 
 
Jeans from  legendlondonco  obviously "
4264,mattdoesfitness,influencers,"Woke up this morning at 92.7kg and feeling good. I’ve slowly ramped up calories over the last couple of weeks and I’m now at a point where I can pretty much eat what I want without gaining weight. I’m not tracking but I’d estimate that I’m eating around 3-3.5k cals a day. Something that’s helped enormously is drastically increasing my daily protein consumption  previously 100-120g but now up at 200g   which has had a massive impact on satiety and also probably assisted in me retaining muscle mass whilst losing weight.
 
In other news  my plan with regards to drug testing  training   diet is almost sorted and it’s gonna be mad. As soon as it’s finalised I’ll explain all in a YouTube video "
4265,mattdoesfitness,influencers,Looks like we’re gonna have to accept the fact that  for the foreseeable future at least  Luca will be identifying as a dinosaur in pretty much every family photo

 Cuffed cable lateral raises  4 x 14 reps
 Kneeling DB lateral raises  4 x 12 reps

4268,mattdoesfitness,influencers,The place we’re staying is awesome but I keep catching the local mailman trying to squeeze watermelons through our letterbox. I have no idea what he’s up to but apparently he calls himself Post Melone
4269,mattdoesfitness,influencers,"Despite what our expressions would have you believe  we’re having the sickest time out here in Lanzarote 
 
Massive shoutout to  lanzaroteretreats who’ve looked after us yet again - we’ve stayed with them four times now   they always go out of their way to make sure we have an awesome time. Absolute heroes "
4270,mattdoesfitness,influencers,2021 vs 2019 
4271,mattdoesfitness,influencers,When you realise that pre-bath vindaloo was a terrible idea…
4272,mattdoesfitness,influencers,Was struggling to catch anything with the net so decided to use my bare hands instead 
4273,mattdoesfitness,influencers,When you’re in the midst of a family photo shoot and you notice that the buffet’s just opened…
4274,mattdoesfitness,influencers,Weight has stabilised at ~93kg over the last week or so. Plan is to sit at maintenance  with a view to possibly building a bit of muscle  until I figure out a timeline for the next few months. On that front  I’m going to be jumping on a podcast with  moreplatesmoredates very soon to help formulate a game plan. Looking forward to the absolute plethora of apologies I’m about to be owed 
4275,mattdoesfitness,influencers,"Sairs and I are breaking up…
 
…BREAKING UP THE FITNESS SCENE WITH THE SINGLE GREATEST TRAINING APP IN THE HISTORY OF HUMAN CIVILISATION  
 
Sorry  that was probably a bit over the top. What I’m trying to say is that after about 3 million requests for Sairs’ training programme  it’s finally live on the Morsia App  
 
If you’d like to try the exact training plan that Sairs has been using for the last few months  use the link in my bio and sign-up today for FREE  "
4276,mattdoesfitness,influencers,"97.0kg on the left vs 93.7kg on the right. 3.3kg down in 3.5 weeks and looking exactly the same. Sick
 
All jokes aside  this is exactly my point when I talk about my favourable fat deposition. I put the majority of my fat on my lower back   upper legs which means that  although I’m probably carrying around 2  less body fat on the right  it’s barely noticeable in an Instagram pic. This is why people tend to assume I’m leaner than I actually am. On the plus side  it appears that I haven’t lost any muscle yet which is ideal. Huge video going up on Sunday which outlines the plan moving forwards btw "
4277,mattdoesfitness,influencers,The first and last time I let this dirty nipple grabbing melt set foot in my gym
4278,mattdoesfitness,influencers,"Sickest holiday has come to an end but it’s good to be back home. Jokes. It’s cold and raining. Here are some highlights from the trip 
 
Also  we’re off again in two weeks  First person to guess where we’re going wins a night with my Dad all expenses paid. Good luck "

4281,mattdoesfitness,influencers,"Physique update mate 
Weighed in at 95.5kg this morning   despite what my facial expression would have you believe  I’m feeling good. Weight had plateaued at 97kg for a few days  was starting to panic   but is dropping fast now   actually had to deliberately increase food yesterday to stem the tide. Swipe left for a comparison with 97kg a week ago. Also  yesterday’s DEXA scan vid was filmed 2 weeks ago - body fat is clearly lower now  
 
What do you think would be a good goal weight for me  "
4282,mattdoesfitness,influencers,"The cut is going well 
 
p.s. tag someone you’d smash this breakfast with
 
p.p.s. people who write ‘tag someone you’d smash this breakfast with’ in their Instagram captions are probably gimps"

4285,mattdoesfitness,influencers,"So  here’s the starting point  tensed   relaxed . Weighed in this morning at 97.0kg. Actually started cutting about 2 weeks ago when I was sitting at around 99kg but forgot to take a pic. Plan is to cut until I get bored/miss doughnuts   pizza too much but hopefully achieve the most outrageous natty physique you’ve ever seen in the process. Game on mate

4540,oliviadbowen,influencers," Ad  Excited to finally reveal that  ab bowen and I have joined  cgbabyclub as part of their  LoveDontJudge initiative to stop parental judgement before it starts.

 Can you believe 7 in 10 parents feel judged on a regular basis  Alex and I are no strangers to judgement  Ever since entering the villa we’ve had comments and opinions thrown our way  but when we announced we were pregnant I was shocked at the number of negative messages I received. Criticising our parenting abilities before we’ve even had a chance to get our heads around this next stage of our lives  Comments on my diet  how baby-friendly our house is  to criticising me for posing in my underwear on my social media.

 To be frank  it’s made me feel scared and is already making me question my ability to be a parent. These judgements must stop  not just for me but all parents and carers.

 We spent some time reflecting on the volume of comments not just Alex and myself have received but other parents too and it was truly overwhelming. This video brings some of those to life… it was really satisfying to grab the paint roller and start striking through the judgements.

 Head on over to  cgbabyclub for more info on how you can access free advice  tips and support and encourage everyone to judge less and support more "

4546,oliviadbowen,influencers,"Anyone else as childish as us still  Yes that is me explaining perineal massage to Alex using  my expertmidwife Peri Prep Your Bits  in all seriousness though guys  it’s something I learnt about a while ago   have had discussions with my friends about it too  Prepping for labour can come in many shapes   forms whether it’s mentally or physically - physically you can do what’s called a perineal massage to help promote skin elasticity   prevent tears. You use this oil sparingly which is full of avocado oil  sweet almond oil as well as lavender and eucalyptus essential oils  which are amazing for your skin. 
 
My midwife has also recommended doing the perineal massage   explained it in our visits   you can do this from 34 weeks pregnant  You can get your partner to help you  I dare you to try not to laugh at first  it may be impossible  but with practice you will soon get into a rhythm and routine   
The website has a full breakdown of how exactly to do this massage   what the benefits are  I’m so grateful for my friends   you guys on here because I actually first heard about this from all of you  It was one of your fave products from My Expert Midwife so I’m so happy to be sharing the love for taking control of our bodies   finding ways to prep for labour   MyExpertMidwife  Labourprep  Ad"

I actually asked you guys what you thought about them   I got THOUSANDS  no exaggeration  literally 1000’s  of messages saying how much you love their products. I am absolutely in love with the smell   the way it feels on my belly. It’s so soothing   hydrating.

To be honest  I’ve said it before I’m not fussed if I get stretch marks  I already have some on my boobs   bum from years ago   I’ve always actually thought they were cute  It’s really for me  all about such a soothing part of my routine   it makes me feel closer to baby - it’s a lovely thing to do to bond with them. It helps reduce the appearance of stretch marks so that’s just a bonus for me  The Marvellous Massaging Stick was a new product I tried which I loved because I’ve made Alex get fully involved   massage my back   my lower back when it’s feeling tight   sore

Many people ask me  “when are the best time of the day to use the sauna” and I usually suggest the same as I do with training - “when you can.”

A few things to note are 

Replace your minerals when you sweat  like some electrolytes  especially if you have a reverse osmosis filter that strips your water.

Morning and afternoon are better if you are prone to waking up during the night for a pee.

When you use the sauna  you will naturally drink more. I can quickly drink another 2.5 litres within 45 minutes. So  just before bed could be a problem  sometimes.

I find that you can get a clean shave in one too. People may not appreciate it in a public sauna so having your own is pretty cool. Check out  clearlight life and see what infrared saunas are all about.

From the first observation  I can see different facial expressions. Okay  let’s move on…

I’m unsure whether my ability to build muscle is slightly less now or because my diet is more refined  I’m somewhat smaller in 2021.

I used to eat five meals a day  but now it’s reduced to 2  on average 

I’m toying with the idea of moving to 3 meals or increasing my calories.

I had a recent blood test. It showed much work that needed to be done. One of which was an increase in my protein.

This year 2022  I’m looking to expand my training and do more combat style training and resistance training  so the demand for protein and other nutrients will be critical.

Minimising my food would create too much stress on the body  so I need to adapt.

Having the right supplements during this time will be one of my foundations.     to see which brands I use.

I’ll need to adapt my training to compliment any martial arts I learn too. It’s all fun and also challenging  but it’s all good.

Have you ever had sh tty stuff happen but somehow you’ve remained unaffected  Even if it was something really important.

You were still energetic and pumped with a feeling that you know that the situation will work itself out.

What about when something great has happened  You heard some good news but somehow you felt low in energy and you found it strenuous to even smile 

Like times when you waited for good news for so long by the time you get it you’ve already waved the white flag in defeat.

We can’t force ourselves to feel good but it’s important for us to train our mind to remain centred.

I like the idea of not being over emotional even when we’re happy. I’ve observed that the overly excited people have the biggest depressive moments. Like bipolar.

It’s good to celebrate our victories in life. I feel we can do this with a sense of gratitude and joy without being fiercely energetic.

Today I completed a sumo deadlift. The plan is to either head back to the gym to train again later or I’ll train at home.

As you probably know  training legs is a great way to maximise growth  upping your testosterone and growth hormone more than any other exercise

Sumo deadlifts are slightly easier than conventional deadlifts for most people.

Using the Olympic platform with bumper plates makes it even easier too. Primary because you can bounce it off the floor from each repetition  further reducing the degree to which you lift it from the ground.

The goal wasn’t necessarily to opt for easier but to make you informed if you were unaware.

Because of the wide stance on sumo deadlifts  it places a lot of tension on the glutes. The weight is heavily set in the centre.

The distance travelled from the ground to standing is less  so technically you could lift more. A few things to note are 

 If you have weak glutes  then this type of deadlift could be more challenging.

 weak glutes translates typically to problems with hips because of decreased mobility and knees problems.

 Strong glutes can reduce some lower back pain.

 Strong glutes mean more functional bedroom action 

Sumo deadlifts hit many other muscles like the traditional deadlift 



 



Most “bodybuilders” who do this exercise would use it to focus on building Glutes  Quads and Adductors. However not limited to those reasons.

A few good tools to have when deadlifting are a good belt. A   are fantastic  but sometimes people experience a “pinching” sensation.

     . If you’re wearing those Nike trainers with the thick air bubble  then I’d suggest taking them off and don’t disrespect your ankles trying to squat in them.

I wear  vibramfivefingers which are phenomenal for training in.

I would sometimes attend spinning classes where Kris was always present  seated right at the front  dominating. I would sometimes attend two classes back to back  but for Kris  this wasn’t an option. That’s why I will always call him superman.

I was always gassing out and in pain  whereas he would always keep going. His endurance is through the roof  and his upbeat personality is infectious. Legend.

My dude on the right is named Mikhail. I noticed he was always in the gym when I was.

He turned up without fail Monday - Friday. He was and still is part of the 6 am club. When the doors opened  he was one of the first to touch the machines  just like me. We one day decided to train together  and we kept it consistent for three years straight  excluding holidays.

Mikhail helped me push myself because I was on cruise control  just maintaining. He showed me about lifting some real weights. Thanks  brother.

A little hard work is good for us. Acute stress allows us to deal with stress.

Adversity in life allows us the opportunity to adapt and overcome. We end up being more robust than before the adversity arrived in our life.

A popular video is floating around with Denzel Washington. He says 

      ’  ’     . It would help if you did not take it personally. The devil is just doing his job.

           . When the weight becomes more manageable  you add more weight  making it difficult again.
        

Life itself becomes easier the more weight you are used to pushing. When people crumble under pressure  they haven’t built enough strength to deal with that weight/pressure.

Too much pressure is equally unhealthy. People drown when they have been thrown into the pool s deep end and haven’t learned to swim.

Some people pull themselves out of the pool and become traumatised by the experience  and some people decide to learn from the experience  so it doesn’t happen again. They realise “resistance” underneath your feet and hands will keep you floating and flowing with the current.

Let’s get stronger from resistance and not resist ourselves from it.

My father s wishes were to be cremated. When I was younger  I adopted the idea that “        ” the thought of being fried to ashes bewildered me.

It makes sense now. The scattering of ashes across different lands has a lot of meanings to many people.

          .

When I arrived at the crematorium gates  I met this senior gentleman in his late 70s 

He had a fresh bouquet ready to lay down for a friend he lost a couple of years ago. He held the value of his friend so dear to his heart he started to recite memories and share them with me.

He shared how it was crucial for him to visit regularly to show his appreciation for that friendship. It was almost like the friendship was still alive.

He spoke with his eyes  and his voice had a deep frail tone.

He explained how he would clean away any debris or leaves blowing across the stone his friend laid in the cemetery.

The idea that someone can show you the act of love without you being alive was remarkably eye-opening for me.

It s almost strange to think that this gentleman  who I’ve never met before and may never meet again  has given me more insight into  than most people I’ve known in all the years I’ve lived.

If you told a young child that a toy that was buried at the bottom of a box for three years would be thrown away  they would become upset.

They may even cry and start playing with it immediately. That toy is now their favourite.

If you were pondering the idea of purchasing something to realise later  it was a limited edition  your sense of urgency would increase.

On the contrary many wealthy people who had once had a taste of poverty are more determined to remain wealthy than someone who hasn’t had that experience.

Scarcity is one of the most significant factors for people to take action immediately than abundance.

If you haven’t  It’s not as hard as you may think  it just takes practice.

This month many people who follow the Islamic faith will be fasting from sunrise to sunset. It starts from 1st April - 1st May.

Today it would work out   -   in London.

To many  this type of fast would be aggressive and feel impossible to some and a walk in the park for others.

One thing to know is there are many types of fasting.

Fasting has become quite trendy  it’s almost like a fashion statement  but let me share a few thoughts with you before you shun the idea.

If you are on a   then this can be an alternative when wanting to lose body fat.

Sometimes it’s hard to tell friends or family that you can’t eat out or you can’t eat more because this leaves you feeling guilty afterwards.

If you tell someone you are fasting  automatically they respect your discipline  and you will not be pressured.

It reminds me of a time when I used to drink alcohol. 

If I told friends I didn’t want to drink much  they would make it their mission for me to get drunk  like drug pushers. The moment I  told them I don’t drink  the pressure ceased.

I read an experiment conducted with fast food and binge eating. It showed people who ate fast food in a “time-restricted” manner. i.e. within 8 hours or less eating window. Lost more weight than people who ate the same calories over. 12  hour period.

Losing weight is hard especially if you can’t help but snack on the wrong foods.

If you’re going to eat those bad foods  do yourself a favour and try restricting the time frame.

If you eat over 15 hours  try dropping it to 12 hours. Like 8 am - 8 pm  then 9 am - 8 pm  then 9 am - 7 pm etc.

Find a pattern that works and stick to it. You’ll soon find your appetite will slowly reduce  and it becomes easier than restricting the food you consume.

Today I tested it with the bar facing behind. I don’t know whether there is a preferred starting position  but I tried it this way.

What makes this valuable equipment is it makes deadlifts a lot easier.

If you’re concerned about squatting - being crushed under the bar.

Or

Traditional/conventional Deadlift - pulling your back out/ spinal issues.

This could be a safer alternative 

Like a squat and a deadlift  you get the opportunity to work for all the surrounding muscle groups.

Another thing that makes this equipment interesting is you tend to use more quad than the hamstring.

A regular olympic bar has your body positioned lower  and hands in front  activating primarily your posterior chain on the lift  hams  glutes  spinal erector 

The walk through trap has higher handles and in a neutral grip position. Another thing I noticed is the degree that you start. Your body isn’t as low.

It’s an interesting bar I’d even categorise it as a  .

You get the benefit of lifting more without the fear of being in a vulnerable position like the squat and deadlift.

If you want to smash a compound but feel safe doing it give this a go.

Whenever you celebrate something. Like 

A new job
Having a baby
A victory in a game
Prize
Some good news

More great things typically follow it.
It doesn’t stop there. The same traffic jam which you usually find irritating becomes a time to relax and dwell on your happiness.

The same goes for bad news. You receive a phone call which isn’t good. The “phone call” wasn’t good  but somehow your mood within the next hour or entire day has become affected.

I think I talk about energy and frequency quite a lot because I believe it is a vital part of who we are.

The more energy we put into something  the more energy we will get back.

Negative  energy seems to hold a lot of power  so we have to work twice as hard to get a positive outcome 

For instance  Will Smith made one error at the Oscars  and it ended up on every YouTube and news channel. Coincidentally got over 600 000 comments on a reel related to the Oscars. Does the same happen when he does something right 

I squatted a PB yesterday  and rather than celebrating my getting stronger  I had a few people who          decide to     on what they didn’t like about it.

We have to show ourselves some love. Appreciate who we are and celebrate our victories as much as we can. This energy is good for our souls and helps us become better people.

External forces will always try to knock you down. If you trip while climbing up  it’s not just one step you fall back on. Catch yourself while you can and keep climbing.

He made minor spinal adjustments to release some air pockets and fixed the leg positioning.

My main focus was on removing tightness from my posterior chain and having a massage. It felt like real deep tissue work  so the feeling was painful AF. I recall saying  “Mother Of God.”

Some may even have video reels of some funny moments or a collage of memories.

Some people have grown up in foster care and never knew their mother. Some people grew up with their fathers and may of not have built that kind of relationship on knowing who their mothers were.

We all have different circumstances  and we all feel differently towards our mothers.

One thing we can agree on is that we were born from our mother.

We can also agree that we have life  and we are breathing.

Anything else which you have gained over the years is a bonus.

Even if you don’t see eye to eye and have fallen out with your mum  she still gave birth to you.

For years I was trying to understand why my siblings were living with our mother  and I was living with my  step  dad. Years later  when I was a late teen  I asked my mum  and she said  “He needed a house from the council and the only way he could get one was if he was a single father” she handed me over to him and I lived with him until I was 17 before I ran away.

Looking back  I was upset with my mother  questioning why she didn’t come back for me  When I told her I was suffering from depression living with my dad  she told me her home was too full  and I couldn’t live there. It was painful.

I decided to change the narrative.

My life is because of my mother. This means all the people s lives that I have touched or have met is because of my mother. My health is because of my mother. All of the grandkids my mum has accumulated between my siblings and me is because of her.

You may have had a troubled childhood and dislike your mother  but I want to suggest in trying to have a fresh perspective. It’s good for your mental well-being too.

Some sexsperts say having your solo entertainment is ok but duo is better.

This post is mainly directed to men  trans-men or those who’d rather not be categorised and have a working penis that has blood flow going through it and ejaculates sperm.

Sex and masturbation is slightly different even if you ejaculate on both occasions. It seems as though sex with a partner creates a bond whether it’s a life partner or not you release oxytocin with a mix of other hormones like serotonin and dopamine.

Sex is satisfactory  with the right person  you don’t feel low from intercourse but guys may feel depleted a little.

Masturbation is a dopamine and endorphin high. The trouble is just like any drug which lifts our dopamine super high it normally comes with a super low. So we chance after it.

Each time a person who has a penis ejaculates they are losing a lot of minerals. Zinc probably being the most.  You could probably Google search the details on what others are 

If you are not replenishing then you are depleting. Low zinc raises chances of copper toxicity and also lowers your immune system.

In a very quick overview way of putting it 

If you keep ejaculating and not replenish yourself AND if you keep chasing that dopamine high - You’d probably end up feeling less energetic  less optimistic  edgy and desperate.

I think more studies need to be done whether it effects your testosterone but lowering your zinc can possibly lead to this.

My advice. Less tugging on your soldier is probably going to be more beneficial than not.

4778,rogersnipes,influencers,"Stress is so commonplace for us we consider it as usual 

It starts in mind  then it ends up in the body  then it ends up in the grave.

One thing which I learned about my father after he passed was that he never stressed about anything. If he couldn’t make a change to something  he would only focus on what he could control. He made it to 94.

Stress makes us vulnerable to Illness  and we stay switched on for hours. We may recover slightly only when we sleep.

Here are some practices to help you deal with stress.

 - when you’re stressed  you tend to breathe less. Breathing deep brings more oxygen to the brain and the muscles. You’ll feel less sluggish and more focused

 Dont drink alcohol. Magnesium is an essential nutrient that gets depleted during stress  so you should be taking more to avoid deficiency. Check out BiOptimizers - LINK IN BIO.

 I’m a big fan of caffeine  however  when you are jacked up on cortisol  any caffeinated beverage will only make you feel more stressed. It can feel tough to move away from it but try lighter caffeine if necessary  like Matcha Tea. Keep away from energy drinks too.

   sometimes  when we have so many things to do  we should write it down. We have a magnificent brain  but we can take the stress off by making a to-do list in order of priority.

If it is something you don’t need to do  but it’s on your mind  perhaps you can journal it. Write down the feelings you have and the concerns you have too. It somehow has some magic to it.

     natures food is one of the best things we can do. Unless you’re on a carnivore diet  this should be part of your consumption daily. They are high vibrational energetic foods that help detoxify the bad and lift you. Process food only increases stress in the body  so minimise or move away.

   when stressed physical training can help some people. Some people may feel more stressed when hitting the gym. Universally it is ok to go for a walk. Preferably through a park and not the high street with lots of car fumes.

4781,rogersnipes,influencers,"Many people understand that the energy we create circles back to us.

That’s why emotionally agile people very rarely complain. They understand that joy and happiness is the elixir of life. 

They shine to the world  and the world shines back.

If you’re a person who wishes bad things to happen to a “bad person”  then this is also part of  karma.

Getting joy from the suffering of someone you dislike creates your own Karma. If their energy is dark or evil  then their karma has been developed through their actions and thoughts.

However  you wishing  on someone who “acts” bad doesn’t do anything  for you even if it “feels” right.

You could be blocking your own blessings and be one of those people who says 

“ ’                ”

Do you remember when you couldn’t swim 

Or maybe for some  a time when you first learned to cycle your bike 

     . You didn’t want to drown. The idea of letting go of the side of the pool was translated as “death” your logic was “I’m not trying to die”

The idea of taking your feet off the floor with your bike translated in your mind as falling sideways on your shoulder breaking your arm and scraping the hell out of your skin.

            .

Fear didn’t disappear but your desire to make this achievement was more powerful.

You were still scared as hell but something inside you said           

When you have  and  C͟O͟U͟R͟A͟G͟E͟ ͟ ͟ ͟I͟S͟ ͟A͟C͟T͟I͟V͟A͟T͟E͟D͟.

Your adrenaline was released and you went for it. You splashed in the water for dear life to make it to your destination.

Perhaps it was your teacher or your parent on the other end cheering you on. Your hands collided with the water and you kicked in a desperate bid to keep your head high enough. You may of even swallowed some or choked along the way.    .

If it were the bike  you probably were looking face down on the floor. Eyes on the very place you weren’t trying to have your face kiss.

You probably gripped the handle bars so tight your fingers lost blood flow.

As you started to move your heart palpitated faster and the bars were shaking more than the wheels were moving.

The trembles slowly subsided as you started to gained momentum then before you knew it the scene in front of you started to change and the breeze on your face started to feel like bliss.

“I’m cycling” 

We all have moments in our life where fear decides to pay us a visit. It says 

“Look  I know what your thinking but I don’t believe this is a  idea”

Your goal is to say “Thanks fear  but ’    you can trust me.

It’s often regarded as respectable if you sleep less in pursuit of goals.

I remember watching a motivation video where Arnold Schwarzenegger said   

There is some validity to the quality of sleep. Many studies suggest between 7-8 hours  and some recon they can only achieve 5 or 6 hours.

Sometimes we can’t change our circumstances to get in those hours due to work and family commitments  but we can influence our lifestyle.

  Take note of all the tips in this video  and it will improve.

    

Lavender oil/candle or incense 
Pepper mind tea 
Mild/ calming music before bed 
Switch off from mentally challenging or emotional stuff a couple of hours before bed.

 A note for you gym-goers. If I can’t get to the gym by early afternoon  I tend to skip gym most of the time. Not because I feel lazy but because I would prefer to wind down earlier  so my hormones are balanced the next day.

  - easier to build muscle.
    growth and repair 
   cortisol  - better brain health
 - less or no cravings
 - less or no over eating.

 Not limited to these hormones 

Again  everyone’s circumstances are different and see what works for you.

Make sure to check out   as part of your sleep ammunition.

Better restoration after shorter sleep is more “bang for your buck” if you can’t get the total 7 or 8 hours.

I lost my father. 

He died at 3 30 am at the age of 94. It was a good run  but his time was to return to our ancestors.

An intro to my story  if you don’t already know  is I never knew my biological father very well. He was introduced into my life when I was 21 years old.

We exchanged a few words at the beginning when we met  but we never kept it consistent. The communication slowly drifted.

I knew he was there  but I guess I never knew what to say to him.

Twenty-two years later  the universe spoke to me by saying  Get in contact.

I learned he was was going through different stages of dementia  progressively deteriorating and no longer physically mobile. He was fighting strong  but then he contracted c v d l9 and more difficulties settled in.

I also learned he was an active man in his younger years. He jogged  skated and lifted weights.

My mother met him while he was in his 50s. She was in her 20s. Somehow she was still attracted to him 

It’s interesting because my dad  who I grew up with  wasn’t into fitness  it was quite the opposite. He smoked Benson and Hedges cigarettes  drank Tenants  Captain Morgan/White rum or Kestral lager every day. I often wondered why I had this obsession with health. It makes sense now.

I don’t know the details on when my father stopped the physical activity or his eating habits. I just know he was very active when he lived in Trinidad 

I soon discovered a new brother and sister  which was an absolute pleasure. I also discovered a huge family on my father s side who were dotted at different parts of the world 

I hope my father achieved whatever his life mission was. Although I never knew him  I’m still blessed he gave me existence.

The good news is at least I know I have the longevity genes. Thanks pops.

The moment you stand out from the crowd it’s easy for others to see you.

Liar
Selfish

Cheat

Simply because you have an ambition for success.

Even successful people will criticise others who are successful. Simply because they want to be “better”

The idea that someone is working hard or harder than them highlights the fact that they can do more or they aren’t doing enough.

 Nobody wants to admit they are lazy or inefficient with their time so it’s better “in their head” if they blame you.

I feel as though having a “get sh t done” mentality really keeps me progress in all areas of my fitness.

It’s so easy to be average. Just follow what everyone else is doing. When you have a bunch of excuses guess what happens  The “average” people will be there to support your behaviour. They will comfort you.

I was told when you reach 40 it will be so difficult to keep in shape. Well  I’m 3 years in and I’m becoming stronger  wiser and my shape isn’t too bad either.

I must admit I do need longer warm ups.
I can’t eat the same sin food/cheat meals and get away with it. I gain weight easier.
I’m not as fast in movement.
I need longer for recovery.

’      

I use this information to make adjustments.

I do more slow eccentric training.
Less sin food is better for me anyway. I cook more and use fun ingredients which are less dangerous for the body.
I’m not trying to be the fastest anymore and I’m ok with that. More cycling than running too as it’s less impact on the knees.
Making better choices in life helps me to recover like my younger self.

4794,rogersnipes,influencers,Does this count as a selfie  
4795,rogersnipes,influencers,"In my teens and early 20s  I didn’t understand the greatness that a woman possessed.

My Dad didn’t teach me much about women except  “Never rely on one” he enjoyed the company of women but never showed me the beauty of a quality relationship.

I never grew up with my mother  but I visited her part-time. I noticed she was very hard working.

My mum was illiterate  with no job prospects and three kids as a single mum living on benefits in a council house. I never appreciated the difficulty it took for her to go through that.

She could never read applications. School reports couldn’t be understood. But as long as her babies were safe  this is all she cared about.

I remember when my older sister was a young kid. She used to urinate on herself in school. One of another kid s parents made a rude comment to her  and I think she may have shoved her. There was physical contact.

When my mum found out  she was furious. She  black woman style  took her earrings out  wrapped her hair in a bandana  went to the school and drop kicked the other parent on school grounds. My mum wasn’t good with words  but she would have lyrics when her fist collided with someone’s face.

My stepmother  who had three kids with my dad  was hardworking. She was highly educated and driven. She was always reading or studying  working part-time while taking care of her kids  and I made the fourth while dealing with my dad. He was a psychological and physically abusive alcoholic.

I understand how much extra effort it takes for a woman to be heard or be recognised in this world as a worthy human being. Sometimes  not always   women are not accepted as serious  so they choose to settle.

Some women over the years have made some earth-shaking influences. For a woman  to make an impact  people need to recognise this would have taken a lot of ridicule but  most importantly  deep rooted self-belief.

To all the mothers taking care of our next generational leaders.

To all the female entrepreneurs whose visions have materialised.

To the ladies who had spent many years shouting before their voice was heard.

Does it depend on your situation on how your outlook will be  Sometimes.

I remember when I was a boy. If I didn’t finish the food on my plate  my dad said  “Put it in the fridge  and you’ll have it for breakfast” if I “forgot” to make it for breakfast  then I would have it for dinner again. Food was rarely thrown away.

Today. I would save the food as before and only throw food away if it shows signs of decomposing  like white or green fur.

It feels empowering when you have no desire to buy the latest trending thing.

Do you jump at sales  Many people say “if I need anything” when the truth is  they don’t need it. It’s a want.

I received a sales email which said  “you deserve a break” I clicked on the email link  and it was a company trying to sell me a holiday. I don’t need to pay for a flight out of the country to take a break. I can sit on my sofa  and it’s free.

If I want a holiday  I’ll take one. It’s essential not to lose your identity by falling for the temptations of the world. As the expression goes  Stand for something  or you will fall for everything.

If you have the spirit in you then    .

    

If you want to go heavy on your last set but you’re unsure you have enough left in the tank then make sure you think of safety.

Don’t do a heavy bench press when you’re low on fuel unless you have a spotter…a good spotter. Check their resume if necessary.

Alternatively you can use hammer strength or some kind of plate loaded equipment. In most cases you can just release and you should be safe. ’     coz you can f  k up the machine.

It’s better to try and go heavy on a hack squat than a barbell.

Psychologically when you finish strong it gives you the illusion that the session was easy and you could of stayed for another hour and you leave the gym feeling like a boss.


     If not  give it a go and let me know how you feel.


͟͟͟͟͟ ͟͟
 Remember  safety first. Don’t attempt this without a spotter if you’re unsure.
 squats  deadlifts  bench press and overhead barbell press could be dangerous.

I ate a lot  so I needed to “work it off” that’s my logic  and it works for me. But it may not work for all.

It’s so difficult to accept when we make excuses all the time  especially when people like to remind us when we are doing it.

It helps our conscience if we can sell ourselves the idea that it’s a legitimate reason and not an excuse.

We build compelling stories and sell them to our friends and loved ones to avoid taking action. If they agree with our story  then this grants us a free pass and excuses us.

It’s better to say “I’m not doing it” than to procrastinate all your life.

Excuses are like the hyperactive salesman. Even he is trying to believe his sales pitch. He becomes more detailed and animated with his approach.

I remember I had a “friend” who would lie all the time. Even though I knew he was lying because he always did  I was still convinced by his story because of his passion.

Excuses eventually wear thin  and we lose hope and belief in ourselves.

This exercise is pretty awesome. It’s not the most comfortable when unracking or re-racking  but when you get into the motion  it feels natural. It primarily focuses on the clavicle section of the pecs  so if you’re looking for an upper shelf on the chest  then this is the one.

  
Pretty cool bar. I like this because it’s easier on the shoulders when squatting. Perhaps I need to work on shoulder mobility  but that’s another story.
The weight on this bar is front-loaded  so if you’re trying to target squads and find front squats challenging then  this is great.

  
Nothing super special about this one  except I think leg extensions are suitable for pre-exhaust or a finisher. Single leg isolation lets you know both legs are being targeted evenly. I don’t always use this  but it’s nice to add it once in a while.

I was born   . On a Monday afternoon. It seems so weird to think I was born in the borderline 70s and now we are in .

I remember having a black and white TV in my bedroom  double tape desk ghetto blaster and felt like I was big pimpin’

I remember rocking a Fresh Prince skin fade and jeans sagging off my skinny ass.

The quest to fit in was very difficult. I wasn’t quite like most of my black friends and I definitely wasn’t like my white friends.

To this day I’ve always felt different. Although I like people  sometimes  I also love alone time. I enjoy my own company quite a lot. That’s why lockdown was a piece of cake for me.

On another note  I feel really blessed. Gods work with me isn’t finished yet so I get the opportunity to do more nurturing things on planet Earth 

I speak out to my guardian angels and spirit guides every day. Through my active mind I sometimes hear when they speak back to me. It’s a work in progress.

When people say things like “I’m so old” and they are in their mid 30s or even 50s I think to myself “If only you were so lucky”

I’d be so blessed to say “I’m so old”
The chance to see the world transition through different eras and be a part of that would be amazing.

This human experience is very interesting to me. I’m taking notes and trying to learn how to do it well. With my experiences I hope that I can use social media to shine light on other peoples lives and allow them to learn with me.

I feel it’s important to celebrate life daily. It’s cool to have a calendar to remind us that the Earth has spun another 365 days since we were born. But if a person only celebrates once a year then that would mean only 43 times for me.

15 695 days lived   \-  and celebrate only 43  The first 16 of those would probably be limited celebration since your parents will let you know what the perimeters are so now I’m down to 27. Not cool

If you want to hit different angles of the biceps then this is a pretty good exercise. It targets brachialis  long and short head  and brachioradialis which is a sexy name for a part of the forearm.

You can do variations of this like 
1  Curl up then reverse curl down - then repeat
2  Or curl up  reverse curl down  reverse curl up  reverse curl down - then repeat.

    

When rowing it depends on how your hands are positioned to determine which part of your back you’ll be targeting the most.

With an underhand or reverse grip you tend to target more lower lats but also rhomboids and biceps.

 Isometric - nice to add to any exercise when you don’t necessarily want to increase the weight but want to increase the tention.

   If you have a strong back but weak biceps then it may be best doing this exercise first.

This can be performed with dumbbells



A cool compound exercise which most people are no stranger to. Performed correctly this will contribute to making you more of a robust human. Performed incorrectly and it could do the opposite.

I’ve witnessed a lot of banana back deadlifts. Learn to do it correctly or keep away from it for your own safety.

When you perform a deadlift your ass should be up NOT seated at 90º  aim for 45°

A traditional deadlift focuses more on posterior chain so if you want to hit quads then so   or  .

I got the flu. 

Yep  flu has been on vacation since there has been a new sheriff in town  but flu decided to pay me a visit—cheers  bro.

I completed a home test for the other thing that everyone talks about  and it was negative.

Many of my appointments had to be rescheduled because my head was in extreme pain. My body too.

I’d be shivering during the day  and at night when I was asleep  my body temperature would rise. I didn’t have an appetite for anything with protein  however  the fruit was my best friend. My tastebuds were refined  in case you were wondering.

Despite the uncomfortable experience I believe it was the universes way of telling me to slow down.

Have you ever asked someone how they were  but you don’t actually listen to the response because you’re already trying to figure out the next generic question 

We do so many things on autopilot that we forget to disengage and be present.

I meditate  but habitually  I ve given a small slot to meditation. This week I found it physically and mentally challenging to do anything. The only thing I could do was relax  be present and meditate.

This post isn’t about meditation. But it is about not focusing on the traffic and enjoying the luxury of a vehicle  not wolfing down your meal to finish a task but enjoying each flavourful bite. Not complaining about the weather but appreciating nature at work.

I read this quote in a book recently. It’s called Big Potential - Shawn Achor.

Schools grade you higher for the least amount of mistakes you make  but life grades you higher when you make more of them.

It doesn’t surprise me that most people are afraid to make mistakes or failures since the educational system breeds the concept of “full marks” the more you get right  the smarter you are….apparently.

People who have reached rock bottom in their life sometimes make some extraordinary growth. Why   If you’re already at the bottom  then what do you have to lose 

You’ve probably learned by now that when you make a plan  “life” decides to add a few hurdles  roadblocks and diversions. With this  you usually     .

Making mistakes in life helps you to build better contingencies.

Posting on social media “life sucks” is not a contingency.

You learn what doesn’t work. You can omit the tried and tested. You build a bigger picture. Most importantly  life will educate you if you choose to listen to it.

 SWIPE LEFT  

I’m genuinely fascinated with the idea that we can now look into genes and understand what our potential is or where our main strengths or weakness are.

Depending on your genotype  you may have a different genetic response to certain lifestyle factors. Fascinating.

It s like “knowledge isn’t power  it’s ”

I firstly have to give a big shout out to mum and dad for giving me a lovely blueprint to work with.

The reports I have attached are a tiny part of the enormous picture. However  I do find it interesting that my  -  is 57/43.

Tipping over to  slightly. Contrary to how my body looks  I love endurance. As many of you know  I used to sprint in my early teens  and weight lifting was primarily to improve my power. I soon fell in love with the weights and never looked back.

I’ve never had any major injuries. I thought that was very normal until I heard from peoples experiences.

A few  to my genetics which I have to work with are 

I have a lower sensitivity for genes related to fat absorption. This impacts the way my body absorbs  transports and metabolises dietary fat.

Not a massive con  but smoked or chargrilled animal protein is not suitable for me. It can contribute to DNA damage.

My body doesn’t detox very well.  It has a reduced capacity to remove unstable molecules  so I need to up my intake of certain fruits and veg 

Vitamin A  1500 mcg/day
Vitamin C  >105 mg/day 
Vitamin E  150 mg/day
Vitamin D  800IU
Calcium 1300 calcium

I have a slightly lower GPX1 enzyme activity. This means I require 100 mcg/day of selenium.

 Although you should eat your fruits and veg for me it is a necessity to eat a variety 

I have a high sensitivity to salt. I need to watch my intake.

I’m lactose intolerant. I do have enzymes for that.

So  what you see on the surface doesn’t give you a broad spectrum of the whole picture.

It is an in-depth discussion about all types of EMFs  from electrical appliances you have in your house to wireless routers and railways  5G  

My focus today is mainly mobiles/cell phones. To receive a signal  your phone needs to communicate via radio waves. These waves  although “non-ionising”  may not be as safe as we have been told. Like most things 

Some people may experience headaches/ migraines  issues with focus  dizziness  insomnia  to name a few.

Seeing children with mobiles do concern me  if I’m honest  as their fragile brains are more susceptible to the dangers of radiation.

Bluetooth isn’t great either. I have to hold my hands up and confess I have a few devices. I’d suggest it would be great to minimise the use or get rid of some.

Rather than putting a mobile to your head  you can use EMF protecting headphones from  defendershield. They are wired with a protective cable that doesn’t emit or leak EMF.

4879,rogersnipes,influencers,"Christmas and New Year’s Day is near.        

Every year I make an effort to visit a church to show my respects to Christ.

It’s a weird one because many christian’s would say that Jesus wasn’t even born in December. When you scan the details in the bible it seems most likely true.

I use it as an opportunity to celebrate a great human being that displayed the perfect embodiment of love. A person who was spiritually fulfilled and a non biased individual with a clean soul who set out to change lives.

Whether you are christian or not it is note worthy and admirable. Christian’s believe he is the son of God  and many variations of that . Muslims would say he was a great prophet. Some other religions would say he was a great teacher who performed miracles.

Why am I even talking about this 

Well  it’s that time of year where homes would be decorated with tinsels  snow globes and wreaths.

Stores are filled with turkeys  mince pies  nuts  chocolates and other treats.

We often share stories with children about Santa Claus  elves and reindeers.
We also place presents under a tree in our home.

I like to remind myself that these colourful things are cool but I think it’s important to understand what Christmas is supposed to be about Jesus.

There aren’t much mention on the financial pressure it can cause some family’s trying to keep up with this glitzy festive period.

People become intoxicated and over indulge because….”it’s Christmas”

Most people ask others “what did you get for Christmas ” Believing it’s about about receiving gifts.

We also encourage the idea of lying to our children by telling them some obese white haired man in a red suit broke in the house to give them presents. But it’s ok because he loves children.

What’s your thoughts on Christmas

4880,rogersnipes,influencers,"The brain is a complex organism. We can t live without it  but very few of us understand how it actually works or even take care of it.

We are born with it and thrown a concoction of subjects that our educational system deems as essential. We are expected to feel enchanted with the innate wisdom of piecing life together.

We use the brain while we are consciously aware and when we are asleep. Its functionality never stops  even if we are not deliberately solving problems.

Understanding muscles  what exercises make them grow  and the nutrition that keeps them healthy is similar to how our brain functions.

4882,rogersnipes,influencers,"Living online is living in a state of diversion.

Social media is powerful as it has enabled us to connect with people  which wouldn’t otherwise be possible.

Some have formed beautiful relationships  started business for consumers  B2B or became more educated.

It gives you the selected highlights of the page holders interests to the world.

If you turn up at your friend s house unannounced in the morning  you’ll witness the blemished truth and unfiltered reality - Tired eyes  morning breath and undiluted displeasure through verbal discord.

Social Media is structured while real life has spontaneity.

It’s now very apparent that “likes” provides dopamine responses in the brain. This is responsible for pleasure.

Who doesn’t like pleasure 

Another thing we like is the opportunity to explore new experiences or holiday destinations. This is why activities and holidays are powerful. Lots of dopamine.

Life itself is naturally mundane. We have a few exciting things that happen during the week  but they rarely occur daily. We work  we study  we have responsibilities.

Social media gives you the illusion and fantasy of extreme change. It all happens with a simple swipe.

The more coffee you drink  the more caffeine you need to achieve potency—the same with weights. You can’t stick with the same weights and expect different results.

Our minds are flickering through different locations  stories and emotions. What we witness on the screen within one hour is something we wouldn’t naturally see in many peoples lifetimes.

I’ve been on holiday to beautiful locations  and I’ve witnessed people on their phones for an extended time as they try to fulfil the craving which a holiday no longer fills.

Our attention is fragmented between a glance at “posts  comments and likes” while we talk another human being.

We take the phone to the bathroom to check social media. We check social media the moment someone leaves to go to the bathroom. We use social media to fill in the gaps between tasks. When we meet someone new  we ask them about their social media. Wild

4887,rogersnipes,influencers,"Depression is an      even when it’s shining brightly.

I heard this once somewhere  and it always stuck with me.

I’ve never reached clinical depression  but I’ve had depressing thoughts. It s not nice. It s hard to imagine a cascading slope of depleted enthusiasm for life.

I look at depression like a    . The fulcrum is   and the lever balances two meanings to life. In other words - your interpretation of it.

 Oᖇ  

When every decision  every encounter  every experience through sensory modalities  ancestral DNA  and past life experiences help calculate your understanding of what life means to you.

            .

I think the more you journey the labyrinths of your existence  the less skewed  the more light  the more powerful  the less vulnerable  the more compassionate  the less uncertain you will become.

Depression is not who you are.
“I am depressed.”

It s a lens that you wear to view your world.

Summer has a universal bliss of happiness during this season  which is expected. It’s beautiful.

But seasons change….

During winter is a time when it gets cold and a little uncomfortable for many. When it’s cold  some will even say  “The weather is miserable”.

People need to understand that life is very much the same where we will have some  like the summer weather and the  when winter arrives.

The seasons are there for a reason  and we can’t control them  but we can prepare for them.

Neither is good nor bad  it is just the weather  and we interpret how we feel about it.

Sometimes you will have a day where you can’t lose weight  your mood is off  something you’ve been working on collapses  or nothing seems to be going right for you that day.

The ebb and flow of life thrust us into an unwavering predicament that we feel it’s against our interest.

Humans don’t have all the answers  but we like to believe we do. So if the winter arrives  we want to speak against it because….we know what’s good for us.

When I go to the gym  I just   . I’m not trying to calculate anything  I’m only interested in respecting my body and building myself up as a robust human with the information I’m learning. If I feel I need to rest  I will. If I don’t need as much rest  then I won’t.

I read to learn  and I test the theories. If it works  I note it down. If it doesn’t work  then I note it down. Both are considered helpful for me to grow.

The bull market is when the financial market is on the rise. The bear market when it is on the decline. Only the most competent people will win on both market trends.

4889,rogersnipes,influencers,"I heard this quote when watching Smurfs with my daughter and found this powerful.
 Or maybe she was watching it with me. I guess you’ll never know  

The good news is if you look in the mirror and you are unhappy with the person you see looking back  then you have an option to make changes.

The hardest part is figuring out the steps in between.

Life encourages us to stick with what we know  even if it’s self-sabotaging or doesn’t benefit us anymore.

It may have served you to be aggressive when living in a particular environment but could destroy your family or business if it becomes a lifelong habit or characteristic.

Often  people say  “I’ve been this way for too long  I can’t change”  but it’s more like they can’t see the steps to make it happen.

They’ve invested years in the character they’ve been playing  and to suddenly change will look fraudulent. People will question you or make you question yourself.

4890,rogersnipes,influencers,"I visited London recently. Let’s say the streets were looking quite decorative.

The festivity is growing along with the shopping mayhem.  

I love London. The historical buildings. The museums. The architecture and the vibes.

It’s enriched with such exorbitant energy you can’t help but ride the wave.

If you’re looking for peace and tranquillity  I wouldn’t suggest this is a spot to visit for that  although you could find some high-end massage parlours and prestigious spas.

When you’ve lived somewhere since birth  it’s easy to forget that people worldwide have made it their life goal to reside and start a new beginning that you take for granted.

For some  stepping foot on British soil is an accomplishment. Foreigners study British history more than brits. In fact  I would say many who have earned citizenship appreciate the land more than those born here.

Although the government isn t on many peoples friends lists  we do have a good support system for those in need. Yes  it needs improvement  but it exists.

4891,rogersnipes,influencers,"How you start your morning affects your productivity.

If you meditate and/or pray  then fantastic  this will prime yourself to a tremendous start.

Most people have a hot beverage in the morning  and data shows a higher percentage leans towards coffee.

What blows my mind is many people visit big chain coffee shops  not talking about the type in Amsterdam  and spend at least  20 a week. The worst part is the coffee isn’t even high quality.

If you’re going to spend such a premium  then at least make it organic.

Big coffee chains will serve you beans loaded with mycotoxins and glyphosate  mould and pesticide   then they top it up with flavourful treats so you wouldn’t be none the wiser.

You are literally drinking toxins with sugar or those artificial syrups  which are their alternatives.

I’ll spare you the other dangers 

If you want to improve your morning  then enhance your coffee.

 Go for something organic from sustainable farms.

Toxin-free.

 Rich  bold and smooth in flavour.

 if you want to have that “coffee house” feel  then get a reusable travel mug. Perhaps with their brand name. As long as it’s environmentally friendly.

4896,rogersnipes,influencers," has now become   and people don’t realise it.

I remember watching this thriller movie where this woman was in an elevator.

The woman had noticed two sides of the confinement slowly close in on her. She tried to escape but she couldn’t move and she was crushed.

Sorry about the graphic detail. We will get to the point in a moment.

CCTV footage was found of the escalator. It was learned that she wasn’t actually crushed. She imagined it. It turns out she was hypnotised to believe this  and she gave herself cardiac arrest.

I remember working for a subprime lender. The company would offer loans to people with compromised credit histories. They understood that people would always want something even if they didn’t need it.

Most people would take out credit to buy liabilities to impress people who either don’t know them or do not even care about them.

Many individuals cause themselves anxiety or some form of stress over having material objects. The latest upgrades  newest fashionable trends  the flashiest cars or expensive watches. Exotic holidays. All for the gram.

It’s ok if you have your priorities in place and the deposable income permits you to indulge. I get it.

But just like the lady in the elevator  many people are crushing themselves with worry over the illusion that it is essential when in truth  it is not.

Stress doesn’t find you. You create it.

We have many uncontrollable events in this world which are scary. To add internal pressure on yourself isn’t worth it  especially when your health is at risk. Especially when it is ONLY material.

Spend what you can afford. The risks are too great otherwise."

5310,thebodycoach,influencers,I’d just like to say a huge thank you to all of you for tuning into my documentary on BBC1 this evening The intention of this documentary is to open up conversations around mental health and highlight the support which is out there if you are struggling. It’s so important we talk about our issues and remove the shame  guilt and stigma from mental illness and addiction. I really hope the documentary has helped you in some way but if you need more help and support please visit www.bbc.co.uk/actionline  There you will find links to all the relevant charities and services you may need. Just a heads up regarding my own personal mental health. Since filming the documentary last year I have found a much better balance with my phone and social media. I am in a much more positive place with it all. It was a very emotional process but I’ve come away from it feeling stronger and more positive. Thanks again for all your support. Much love Joe

Amazing   bodycoachapp 

“3 dress sizes down and 4 cup sizes - yes there have been many inches and kg lost but it’s never really been about the numbers for me. 

Now I feel strong both mentally and physically  as well as light  flexible and empowered. I have the energy and motivation to live and do more. 

I feel so much better and sharper. There is no question at all that this has been a lifestyle change. I have maintained my weight for over 18 months and exercised 5/6 days a week since March 2020. I’m now able to be much more flexible with my food  to enjoy celebrations with balance  to experiment in the kitchen - all while fuelling my body properly. Giving it what it needs to be its best. Thanks Joe  The Body Coach

I have never been this fit or this lean genuinely. I’m 43 years old and now some of my favourite teenage clothes I have sentimentally held on to are too big for me as is my wedding dress. Having never felt comfortable in shorts I now have more shorts than anything else in my wardrobe  Amazingly too for me I feel good in a bikini. Instead of picking faults in my bikini pics I look at myself and I’m happy that I look strong and healthy - that’s it. Really proud of that.

I think it’s so important to challenge yourself to change things up. Habits you think would be impossible to change CAN be changed. 

90 day plan done  grad plan complete   I’m now on C9 of the Advanced Plan and loving it. Consistency is absolutely 100  key. For me it took about a year to look at myself and really see and feel the difference and to realise that the lean person in the mirror - that’s me - and if you work on it consistently and believe in yourself it will absolutely  be you too. Go for it and do it for yourself no one else.  ”  You can read Helen’s full story on my Facebook page

“The numbers tell part of the story  12.5kg and 27.5 inches gone   
What they don t tell you I d just how absolutely fantastic and confident I feel in my body”  

————————————-

“I don t know when I ll cease to be amazed by my journey over the past 22 months since starting The Body Coach plan in May 2020. 

Loving the  bodycoachapp and checked in at the end of Advanced Cycle 3 today 

The numbers tell part of the story  12.5kg and 27.5 inches gone   

What they don t tell you I d just how absolutely fantastic and confident I feel in my body. It has also helped me to deal with my mental wellbeing in a much better way.

What s the secret 

 Trust the plan

 Show up every day - not every day will be a smashing one but do your best

 Don t let a bad day become a bad week - brush it off and keep moving forwards

 Let go of things that don t support and serve you - be your first priority

 Exercise and nourish yourself with things that get you excited - these are not rewards or punishments

 Take lots of pics - you will see change

 Be kind to yourself  speak to yourself as you would to someone you love

 Don t compare yourself to anyone else - we are all different

Remember  you will get out what you put in.

 From a size 18 to a size 10.

  I ve gone from really struggling with my mental health  to now feeling massively better  

  I never thought it would happen for me  but it just proves that if you want something badly you can do it  

  Consistency and not giving up is key 

  My goals for this year is to adapt my diet and learn how to now maintain my weight  rather than lose anymore.

  And to tone up and grow lean muscle  especially in my booty which I seem to have lost

5445,thebodycoach,influencers,One thing I’ve really worked on over the past year is my flexibility and mobility. Like all aspects of fitness it takes work  dedication  commitment and discipline. I don’t enjoy doing it. It’s probably the most uncomfortable thing to do but stretching is so important if we want to live pain free and working on the range of motion in your joints is essential for longevity as we get older. I want to be strong but I also want to be able to move my body well and freely as I get older. I probably spend about 15 minutes in total a day at random times. I might do a pigeon pose or hip flexor low lunge stretch whilst watching TV or sometimes I sit on the floor in this splits position whist on a zoom call. That may seem silly but no one cares and it’s the only way I get to fit it in my day. I have to distract myself while I’m doing it or I get too bored and don’t do it. Try to incorporate a little stretching into your day and feel the incredible benefits to your body and training. These photos are almost a year apart. Progress is very slow but it does feel good to see the changes over time. Do you feel you stretch enough   do you have any injuries you think could be helped by doing more  
5446,thebodycoach,influencers,"WOW    Please read this and give  lisacliffordowen a massive high five on her incredible journey  Happy 1000 days Lisa  Amazing   

“1000 days of Joe   Wow saying that out loud blows my mind 

“Give me 90 Days and I’ll Change your life.” I remember  thebodycoach saying that in an insta story 
90 days. Trust him and follow the BodyCoach plan. I looked Him I’m the eye and said you’re on 


I picked up that plan washed out  overweight tired  sad and exhausted  overwhelmed but determined to make a change in myself. I was feeling middle aged and lost and I just didn’t want to feel like that any more  I’d had enough at disengaging with life. I wanted me back  


90 days  3 cycles  of learning to fuel My body. Workout and push myself 5 times a week to get fitter and stronger. Stretch out every day and listen to my body to stay injury free.

And it worked. I gave him 90 days and he literally gave me my life back. He helped Me slowly flip my mindset and live a lifestyle that changes the way you think about yourself.

It immediately improved my health  and in turn my outlook on life and my happiness. My relationships improved  my confidence soared  my sense of self worth returned.

I found a willingness to help others  my physical and mental strength blossomed   I found my sense of fun  my confidence at work returned. For me it changed everything …I found me.

1000 days later I’m still here on my lifestyle fitness journey following Joe’s app. Good days  bad days  meh days  happy cartwheel days  I’m here . Living a healthy happy life.

1000 DAYS   

I’m so proud of me. Thanks Joe "

5459,thebodycoach,influencers,My 3 month progress  I set myself two main goals when I landed in LA three months ago. No 1 was to get more sleep because back home my sleep isn’t consistent and I don’t get enough. I spend too long sitting up on my phone working  watching late night TV or playing Call of Duty with my mates online until midnight. The 2nd goal was to get stronger. To lift heavier weights and get progressively stronger each week just by adding a few extra kilograms or pushing out a few extra reps. What I’ve realised more than ever is that sleep is the foundation that everything stands on. When I sleep better and consistently I wake up with more energy to train harder. When I’ve slept well I also make better food choices. I’ve been asleep about 9.30pm most nights and trained consistently 6 days a week at 6am for 3 months. The challenge for me when I’m back home is to maintain this routine. I’m going to do my best to stick to it because i’m fitter and stronger than I’ve ever been and the sacrifices feel worth it 
5460,thebodycoach,influencers,"Do you feel like you want to spend less time on your phone   

Creating some time off social media has really helped me feel so much calmer and relaxed  It’s helped me feel more present not having the constant distraction of my phone. 

I’m not consuming negative media when I go to bed or first thing in the morning. I’m not getting triggered or stressed by things out of my control and I’m more present and attentive with Rosie  Indie and Marley. I’m happier  I feel more gratitude for the things in my life right now 

Will I do this every single day  Probably not. But I try my very best to continue working on these 3 strategies each day… "

5497,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Here’s some logical and scientific reasons why sugar probably isn’t addictive. 
-

Nutrition is a complex domain these days  but only because so many make up dubious claims based on very little evidence.
-

Like any food  unless you have a specific health condition that requires you to avoid it  you’ll be fine if moderation is achieved. "
5498,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Though the supplement industry have done a grand job at making you think you need specially formulated protein shakes to build muscle  you don’t. Though whey protein  a waste product from milk  is cheap  convenient and an excellent source of protein  you can still build muscle consuming protein from regular foods. 
-

The myth that you can’t eat after 6pm and lose body fat almost entirely derives from the assumption people are more likely to snack more in the evenings. While this might be true  the emphasis should be on snack choices  not the time of day. You can eat at whatever time of day you want and still achieve your fat loss goals.
-

A trending myth is that seed oils are bad for your health because they cause inflammation. Do you know what else causes inflammation  Exercise… Should we all stop exercise  Seed oils have also been shown by the body of research to support cardiovascular health. 
-

Many have touted that eating 6 small meals per day is better for fat loss than fewer  larger meals. The science says it literally doesn’t matter how many meals you eat or what size they are. What matters in total calories in and calories out. 
-

Intermittent fasting zealots keep saying skipping breakfast is better for health because of ‘authophagy’… But the same autophagy occurs with regular calorie restriction while eating breakfast. 
-

And for those who say eating breakfast is better for health  this statement is also false. The truth is your overall health won’t be defined by eating or skipping breakfast. There are countless other variables that are more important. 
-

I hope that one day we can live in a world where these myths are part of a comedy sketch as opposed to bestselling books. "
5499,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"The differentiation between good and bad is one of the vaguest questions known to humans. Both eventualities are ultimately quantified by a long list of beliefs set by subjective  impossible to measure variables. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
When it comes to nutrition  this concept continues  except here it also goes under the extraordinary alias of ‘clean and dirty’. In these examples  we have a items cloned to ‘clean eating’ royalty  and others often referred to as episodes of ‘dirty’ shame.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
The former mirrors sensationalized documentation of nutrient density  the latter is likely be on a hospital pamphlet with a red cross next to it.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Given that some wellness bloggers have outstanding physiques  followers will attempt replicate them  including duplicating what they eat in posts  some of which are paid sponsorships.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
When little progress is made and the follower constantly scrolls upon said blogger’s candid 14  body fat photos  they will become demotivated. They cannot fathom why  despite following all advice.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
It’s probably because the wellness blogger  despite practicing it themselves  has not educated their followers on basic energy balance - instead focusing entirely on the benefits of elevated nutrient consumption and brand sponsorships.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
For example  the nutrient dense granola bowl and juice is more likely to satiate  but amounts to nearly double the calories of ⁣the nutrient sparse McMuffin and hash brown  which still contains reasonable protein .⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Energy balance is the only nutritional strand which directly defines body composition. Therefore  notwithstanding the importance consuming many nutrients for overall health  make sure you at least include it in your thoughts.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Objectively  these items are nutritionally different  but neither are good or bad. Instead  their isolated effect on your health is decided by their affinity with many other variables over time. Removing morality from food is the first step to education and making eating synonymous with happiness. ⁣⁣

5500,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"When in a state of caloric deficit to lose body fat  you can definitely increase the volume of food you consume. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
“I’m losing weight  but I’m eating more than ever before” is a popular dieting statement that may confuse some. Usually because it’s usually born out of the false belief that consuming specific ‘elixir’ superfoods elicit greater fat loss. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
This notion is of course  impossible. In scientific terms  an individual must be in a state of caloric deficit for fat loss to occur in the first instance. But by ‘eating more than you ever have before’ you have simply increased the volume of lower calorie foods across your overall dietary intake. Thus  you are eating higher volumes of food  but fewer total calories.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
As a caloric deficit is the only way fat loss can occur  reducing calorie intake may be difficult for an individual seeking fat loss. Not least because it requires a change in dietary habits and behaviours.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Therefore  it makes perfect sense to consume a relatively high volume of food in order to remain satiated and reduce risk of excessive calorie consumption. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
This can be delivered in the form of lower calorie foods that can be eaten in high volumes. Most fruits and vegetables exists as prime candidates to champion strategic execution of a sustainable calorie deficit  though lower calorie versions of your favourite treats also exist. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Calorie dense foods  including those with or without nutritional value  can also be included as part of a balanced  enjoyable deficit. But there should be realisation that excessive consumption can counter the overall balance of energy over time. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
When all other variables equate  there is no magical metabolic inferno that enables an individual to consume a greater volume of calories than before and lose fat. Instead  greater volumes of food may well be consumed  but this food simply contains fewer overall calories than before. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

5501,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Improving your relationship with food takes time and work. That said  there are some basic elements to consider at the start that appear entirely reasonable  and logical. 
-

It makes no sense to ban foods you love and eat foods you hate in order to optimize your health. Find nutritious foods you enjoy and create a way to include any food you enjoy - even if it isn’t particularly healthful. Your mental health is just as important.
-

Understand that food doesn’t have a moral value. Whether you eat a cinnamon swirl or a salad  nothing about you  or the world  changes. You don’t become a good or bad person based on what you choose to eat.
-

Ignore food conspiracies designed to create fear. Carbs are not bad. Sugar is not poison and chemicals are in all food  nutritious or nutritionally void.
-

Realize that eating a single food has virtually no impact of your health. Rather than getting bogged down on individual choices  make choices based on what your overall diet looks like. 
-

Understand that ultra restriction is unnecessary. It will likely lead to binge eating which could unravel the goal. If you’re hungry  it’s a physiological cue to eat. 
-

Remember  no matter what you deserve to enjoy what you eat. "
5502,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Mars protein bars contain 50  less protein  50  more calories and cost three times more than 3 small  low fat cheeses. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Graze protein ‘boosts’ contain less protein  more calories and cost fifteen times more than 75g uncooked pasta.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
These short statements apply to varying degrees across the rest of the protein marketed items in my graphics. But whilst this may be the case  if they are enjoyed  they must be eaten  despite the expense and exaggerated marketing  culminating in disappointing amounts of protein.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Some of the items on the right of my graphic such as cheese and milk represent protein rich snacks  serving as less expensive solutions to boost protein throughout the day at similar  or lower caloric cost.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Other items included such as pasta  beans  peas  cottage cheese and lentils serve as ingredients that can be deployed in main meals to boost overall protein with relative ease throughout the day. This leaves more scope to include snacks void of exaggerated protein claims like regular chocolate bars similar in caloric load  much lower in cost and that you likely enjoy more.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Many bemoan their inability to achieve protein targets per day. In the example of one trying to achieve a target of 130g protein per day  protein abundant sources like meat  poultry  fish  dairy and eggs could offer 30g protein servings on their own across three meals. But this still leaves 40g yet to achieve.⁣⁣⁣

Instead of dreading another chicken breast for a late supper  understanding that additional sources lower in protein density can still accumulate to achieve the target. For example  4 low fat cheeses for a snack  150g peas and 75g pasta added to meals provides the extra 40g protein at the cost of 569 calories and just  0.77. ⁣⁣⁣

This is true. But there is one small caveat that is conveniently left unmentioned. The caveat is that whilst more fat is burned  this is merely the wheelbarrows of dietary fat consumed  not body fat.

Your digestive system will be in turmoil.

Given the aggressively low energy intake  your energy levels will be extremely low.

Given the lack of satiating foods like protein  fibre based carbs and dietary fats  you’ll feel constantly hungry.

To partake in a juice diet to lose body fat is to be misled into thinking food creating the problem.

But it didn’t inherently. Consistent decisions that led to eating too many calories for the amount of calories burned over time did…

If the frequency of calorie excessive nights out is low  the caloric impact on body composition will follow suit. But if such episodes are regular  despite lasting just a few hours  they can heavily influence body composition over time.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Whilst a night out is there to be enjoyed  one will likely spend the subsequent 24 hours in a state of fatigue and reduced motivation to move and/or adhere to eating protocols which support their goal. This can extend the unsupportive few hours anticipated in the night out to another day of unsupportive behaviours. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If you have a fat loss calorie target of 1800 calories per day  12600 per week   the night out and subsequent day accumulates to around 3/4 of the total weekly calories required to achieve the goal. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Even if you began meticulously adhering to your 1800 calorie target over the next week  you would would still be consuming significantly more weekly calories than required because of the excessive 24 hour period.⁣⁣

Given the short-term caloric ferocity of these episodes and their effect on the big picture  it’s easy to see why many may be confused as to why they aren’t progressing if they adhere to their caloric needs 90  of the time. ⁣⁣

The long term key to taking control of one’s dietary outcomes is to understand that there is no good or bad  only difference.

Balancing these aspects via non-rigid varieties of different foods may be the key to achieving all of the above. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

One’s desire for protein density is usually virtue of knowledge that diets relatively high in protein are advantageous across an array of health and fitness goals. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

⁣
Rather than calories being full or empty  it is the volume of vitamins  minerals  fibre  macronutrients and pleasure within food that make it more or less healthful to you.⁣
⁣
Avocado and eggs may be a useful source of micros which support function  and protein  which via it’s TEF and way it digests  can support fat loss and satiety. But these nutritional benefits do not make the calories within ‘full’.⁣
⁣
By the same token  the fries are a source of food lower in protein and micronutrients  but this doesn’t make the calories within ‘empty’.⁣
⁣
Sometimes  as part of an overall nutritious diet  we can enjoy fries  or any food. The joy they give us is the opposite of emptiness. ⁣
⁣
While we should pursue a diet rich in nutritional value in order to nourish our physical health  we don’t need to relentlessly obtain ultra-nutritious food every time we eat to actually be in good physical health. Doing so may negatively affect our mental health.⁣
⁣
This is why branding food as ‘bad’ or ‘empty’ is as disordered and illogical as it is intellectually useless.⁣
⁣
In essence  calories can never empty or full because  like grams  they are quite a unit of measurement. Just like the gram can tell you how heavy something is  it cannot tell you whether it is measuring feathers or bricks.⁣

The essence appears sound in that waiting for hunger and satiety cue’s before and during eating is helpful. But the first major issue arrives as soon as the hunger is dealt with. Whilst hunger has been intuitively nurtured  the extent of energy consumed is largely unaccounted for.⁣⁣⁣

Thus  the effect on composition is unknown  and possibly counter productive given the ease at which calorie dense  hyper palatable foods can be excessively eaten. ⁣⁣⁣

While you don’t need to be aware of the volume of calories you consume  your body will respond one way or another to the balance of energy you give it. Therefore  being informed on energy attained appears to be a useful strategy if you seek to alter composition. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Ironically  tracking calories is not the prison sentence many portray it as. It is essentially a temporary acquisition of objective data that can allow you to make skilled  intuitively supportive decisions for the rest of your life. ⁣

When zoomed into one specific moment in time 1138 calories consumed across a single meal will appear to be detrimental to adherence to the required calorie deficit needed for fat loss. Especially if said consumption puts the individual hundreds of calories over their daily target. Thus  it is impossible not to see this as a failure.⁣

However  when zooming out  something I discuss in Lose Weight Without Losing Your Mind  to view this 1138 calorie consumption across the context of a week  the story looks very different. If  for example  your fat loss target was 2000 calories per day  this equates to 14000 calories per week to stay on track. ⁣

One example can be found in the ‘Supersize Me’ experiment/documentary in 2004. It professed the negative impact McDonald’s had on the subject’s health. But the subject consumed nothing but McDonald’s food for one whole month. Whilst the findings may have been accurate  they are rendered as entirely useless to those who do not consume 90  McDonald’s meals per month. Thus  we can estimate that the findings from supersize me are irrelevant.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
For optimal health  excessive consumption of fast food is not going to be particularly beneficial. But if consumption is moderate and accompanied by an overall supportive dietary process rich in nutrients  it can have an enjoyed position in one’s life now and again. ⁣

5539,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"To guess means to estimate or conclude something without sufficient information to be sure of being correct. ⁣
⁣
To know means to be aware of something through observation  inquiry or information. ⁣
⁣
When consuming food  the first thought should not be how many calories it has or how nutritious it is  but the how much you enjoy it. From there  considerations about the food’s nutritional validity may be important if health   fitness goals are desired.⁣
⁣
If one if those goals is fat loss  calories consumed may be an important considerations - after all  you require a calorie deficit to lose body fat. Therefore understanding calories consumed is a logical step.⁣
⁣
While many portray calorie counting as a laborious  lifelong ordeal  weighing out every morsel of food forevermore  it needn’t be. In fact  it shouldn’t be. After a few weeks or a couple of months you should be able to accurately eyeball portion sizes and attribute an accurate calorie figure to them.⁣
⁣
But as my graphic demonstrates  under-appreciating the amount of calories you consume can be easily done when the volume is relatively small. This is precisely why appreciating the actual caloric value of the items you consume can be both useful and empowering. ⁣
⁣
For example  knowing that two large caramel macchiatos amount to 670 calories when you’re daily target for fat loss is 1800  allows you to either adjust the amount or type of coffee you select  or accommodate them within the overall target. ⁣
⁣
For those seeking fat loss  rather than embarking on disordered 800 calorie keto diets that promise you the world based on flimsy science  taking a short time to educate yourself of the amount of calories in the portions you consume can be a temporary education that lasts a lifetime  liberated you from the misery of disordered dieting and ultimately changes your life. ⁣

5540,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"For those intending to reduce overall caloric intake in order to reduce fat  these calorie saving meat swaps may provide you with several easy opportunities. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
One immediate observation with these meat sources is that most of the lower calorie alternatives are higher in protein. For example  200g chicken drumstick gets 144 of its calories from protein and the remaining 316 from fat. Whereas the skinless chicken breast gets 192 of its calories from protein and the remaining 18 from fat. Thus  the breast has significantly higher protein density per calorie. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
As there are no carbohydrates present in fresh meat - the calories will always derive from protein or fat. If the calorie value is high  but the protein value is low  it means the meat is high in fat. Fat is not to be feared  but it contains 9 calories per gram  over double the caloric density of protein and carbs. Thus  foods high in fat are relatively high in calories. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
All meats can of course be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet. But if consumed regularly whilst pursuing a calorie deficit for fat loss  you may want to consider more items on the right hand side. After all  you’ll still be experiencing the same volume of food  very similar tastes  but significantly fewer calories which supports a calorie deficit.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Small  effortless changes accumulate over time to produce a bigger result. Why  Because they were so easy to maintain that you kept doing them.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Making the above 9 swaps across 9 varied meals would enable you to save 1491 calories  enjoy the same volume  taste   increase protein intake. Across 90 meals  you’d save nearly 15 000 calories... And so on. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
These swaps offer a practical   enjoyable opportunity for you to significantly alter your calorie intake to support your goal without the overwhelming hassle of planned dietary upheaval or extreme restriction of foods you enjoy.

⁣⁣⁣⁣
Demonized foods usually include refined carbs. Perpetuated myths lead people to believe they must exclude their favourite bread  pasta  rice and potato  and replace them with wholewheat versions to lose weight or improve overall health.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Next door  Ian is heard proclaiming that he is “being good” today by swapping white rice for brown. Yet a closer look at the nutritional value shows that brown rice holds similar caloric and fibre values to white rice - key nutritional variables that cannot be seen from Ian’s moral diagnosis. ⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Rice aside  fibre may be the one main nutritional difference between these carb based foods. Whilst there is more fibre the less refined foods  thus offering more likelihood of satiety  this is not guaranteed. Because despite feeling fuller  we can still choose to eat more.⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
A diet rich in fibre is advised to support overall health  gut in particular. But in terms of composition  it boils down to the same thing again - energy balance. As you can see  there is marginal difference in calories between the potatoes  rice  pasta or bread. Body composition is defined by how we manage our overall energy  regardless of the food type. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Therefore  while consuming higher fibre foods enhances overall health and satiety  this doesn’t mean every single food you eat must be high in fibre. And for fat loss  calories are still of key relevance.⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
For those who argue that coconut oil boosts metabolism  clears brain fog  regulates blood sugar and enhances fat loss  there is simply no reliable research to support these claims. Despite the wellness halo  it is dense in saturated fat and calories. Too much of both can compromise health and composition.⁣

No single food makes you lean or overweight. If white toast and butter is enjoyed  facilitating its inclusion in your informed diet is essential.  ⁣

5543,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"While adherence to Slimming World methods may result in fat loss for some  for others its system may prohibit the necessary understanding required for long term progress.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
A calorie deficit is required to lose fat. But adherence to slimming world does not guarantee that calorie deficit - because it fails to inform its customers about its existence in the first place. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Instead  it instructs its members to follow its own methods. These include telling members they can eat unlimited quantities of ‘free foods’ and still lose fat. Logically  this becomes problematic when such instructions result in members demonstrating no caloric control with these foods - some of which are calorie dense.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Designing an eating system which labels foods as ‘syns and free’ denies the consumer of the very information that would allow them to make informed choices in relation to their goal. As a result  one may drastically over-consume ‘free’ foods  counteracting the calorie deficit required to lose fat. Thus  confusion and poor food relationships are born.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
It overcomplicates a simple principle and becomes redundant if the following is realized  ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
1. A caloric deficit is the only way to lose fat⁣⁣⁣⁣
2. Create a calorie deficit⁣⁣⁣⁣
3. Appreciate caloric values in foods  thus be able to monitor adherence to the calorie deficit. ⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Perhaps Slimming World forego educating their members because in doing so they would become irrelevant. Whilst their marketing focuses on relating with their target market  there is one problem. Nothing they practice relates to fat loss in basic science. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Instead of relying on nonsensical words to define items of food and worsen your food relationship  it might be a better idea to step back into reality and become informed about the food you eat  it’s relationship to your goal and the power it gives you for the rest of your life.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
For those who can’t afford  26/month for an irrelevant system  unskilled advice and yo-yo results  maybe it’s time to step back into the real world. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

5545,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"The point of consuming food is to remain alive. The point of managing our intake of food is to manage our physique and overall health. The point of consuming fewer calories is to reduce body fat across our composition. But one constant in all of the above should be our enjoyment of the food we eat.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
When an individual embarks on fat loss  each of the above are important. They must enjoy their energy consumption  be aware of energy intake in relation to their energy output  and consistently ensure that they are in an average state of caloric deficit over time. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
To ensure progress  they may have to change and adjust their dietary habits. But instead of completely radicalising the diet  adherence to change may be more likely if change is subtle. For example  consuming the same volume of lower calorie foods and drinks that replicate higher the calorie versions in experience and taste.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
This graphic shows two groups of foods/drinks. One group contains more calories than the other  yet quantities remain the same  apart from the Freddo   bagel thin . Crucially  the lower calorie versions resemble similar  or the same palatable offerings as their higher calorie counterparts.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Whilst consumption of lower calorie versions may not be immediately significant  they can be over a period of time. For example  if you swap daily consumption of Greek yogurt for 0  fat greek yogurt  over the course of a year  you would consume 56 210 fewer calories. Your yogurt experience would be minimally compromised.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Such choices must be made with the knowledge that lower calorie items may contain less of a particular macronutrient. And in the case of low calorie beverages  awareness that sweeteners are included. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Losing fat is not straightforward. It requires behaviour change and conscious effort. But if you recognise opportunities to make small changes that reap handsome  long term rewards  it’s seems short sighted not to take them. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

The reason we should all forget these myths is because they are not true.

⁣⁣
Graze protein ‘boosts’ contain less protein  more calories and cost fifteen times more than 75g uncooked pasta.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
These short statements apply to varying degrees across the rest of the protein marketed items in my graphics. But whilst this may be the case  if they are enjoyed  they must be eaten  despite the expense and exaggerated marketing  culminating in disappointing amounts of protein.⁣
⁣⁣
Some of the items on the right of my graphic such as cheese and milk represent protein rich snacks  serving as less expensive solutions to boost protein throughout the day at similar  or lower caloric cost.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Other items included such as pasta  beans  peas  cottage cheese and lentils serve as ingredients that can be deployed in main meals to boost overall protein with relative ease throughout the day. This leaves more scope to include snacks void of exaggerated protein claims like regular chocolate bars similar in caloric load  much lower in cost and that you likely enjoy more.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Many bemoan their inability to achieve protein targets per day. In the example of one trying to achieve a target of 130g protein per day  protein abundant sources like meat  poultry  fish  dairy and eggs could offer 30g protein servings on their own across three meals. But this still leaves 40g yet to achieve.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Instead of dreading another chicken breast for a late supper  understanding that additional sources lower in protein density can still accumulate to achieve the target. For example  4 low fat cheeses for a snack  150g peas and 75g pasta added to meals provides the extra 40g protein at the cost of 569 calories and just  0.77. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Being informed enables you to enrich your decisions with calm decisiveness which serves to support adherence to your goals. You are then able to cut through marketing ploys  instead understanding that over time  forgotten treasures will serve to achieve greater outcomes at significantly less financial outlay. ⁣⁣

When it comes to nutrition  this concept continues  except here it also goes under the extraordinary alias of ‘clean and dirty’. In these examples  we have a items cloned to ‘clean eating’ royalty  and others often referred to as episodes of ‘dirty’ shame.⁣⁣⁣⁣

The former mirrors sensationalized documentation of nutrient density  the latter is likely be on a hospital pamphlet with a red cross next to it.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
When little progress is made and the follower constantly scrolls upon said blogger’s candid 14  body fat photos  they will become demotivated. They cannot fathom why  despite following all advice.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
It’s probably because the wellness blogger  despite practicing it themselves  has not educated their followers on basic energy balance - instead focusing entirely on the benefits of elevated nutrient consumption and brand sponsorships.⁣⁣⁣⁣

For example  the nutrient dense granola bowl and juice is more likely to satiate  but amounts to nearly double the calories of ⁣the nutrient sparse McMuffin and hash brown  which still contains reasonable protein .⁣

Energy balance is the only nutritional strand which directly defines body composition. Therefore  notwithstanding the importance consuming many nutrients for overall health  make sure you at least include it in your thoughts.⁣

Objectively  these items are nutritionally different  but neither are good or bad. Instead  their isolated effect on your health is decided by their affinity with many other variables over time.

⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
“I’m losing weight  but I’m eating more that ever before” is a popular dieting statement that may confuse some. This is mainly because it’s usually born out of the false belief that consuming specific ‘elixir’ superfoods elicit greater fat loss. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
This notion is of course  impossible. In scientific terms  an individual must be in a state of caloric deficit for fat loss to occur in the first instance. But by ‘eating more than ever have before’ you have simply increased the volume of lower calorie foods across your overall dietary intake. Thus  you are eating higher volumes of food  but fewer total calories.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
As a caloric deficit is the only way fat loss can occur  reducing calorie intake may be difficult for an individual seeking fat loss. Not least because it requires a change in dietary habits and behaviours.⁣
⁣
Therefore  it makes perfect sense to consume a relatively high volume of food in order to remain satiated and reduce risk of excessive calorie consumption. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
This can be delivered in the form of lower calorie foods that can be eaten in high volumes. Most fruits and vegetables exists as prime candidates to champion strategic execution of a sustainable calorie deficit  though lower calorie versions of your favourite treats also exist. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Calorie dense foods  including those with or without nutritional value  can be included as part of a moderated calorie deficit if enjoyed. But there should be realisation that excessive consumption can counter-attack the overall balance of energy over time. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
When all other variables equate  there is no magical metabolic inferno that enables an individual to consume a greater volume of calories than before and lose fat. Instead  greater volumes of food may well be consumed  but this food simply contains fewer overall calories than before. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

Though lacking in micronutrient density and generally low in quality  if enjoyed in moderation  this intake of 854 calories can be a liberating cog in one’s engine of optimal physical and mental health. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
That is of course only if one understands and implements caloric control  nutritious abundance and inclusion of enjoyed foods and drinks over time.⁣⁣⁣

In this case  the small meal and dessert would form nearly 50  of one’s 1800 per day calorie intake  less than the snack ensemble and leaving more remaining calories to eat that day. Yet it is often lambasted as a disastrous choice in any instance.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
No food choice can be triumphant or disastrous because there will always be a future choice that will influence your outcome. Depending on what has gone before  it serves as an opportunity to continue  realign  adjust or deploy flexibility. Balancing the above over time will define your nutritional wellbeing and happiness  not a single eating episode.⁣⁣⁣

Consuming a coffee based beverage and small snack in a single episode is perceived a regular societal eating habit - which it absolutely is. But in contrast  eating 6 chocolate bars in a single eating episode is almost always perceived as an episode of binge eating - which it may well be.⁣⁣

But the consequences of our eating episodes may not match our perception. For example  this often lamented binge eating episode will result in consumption of fewer calories than the coffee and small snack which may be consumed without self loathing.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
To be clear  consumption of entire selection boxes may well be the result of binge eating behaviour unrelated to compositional management  and thus  such behaviour over time may result in deterioration of physical and mental health. But in this example  the two episodes may evoke drastically different emotional responses  yet remarkably similar physical responses. ⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣
A large takeaway pizza can contain up to 2600 calories. Put into context  the calories needed to maintain body weight for a lightly active 35 year old  5ft 7 woman  weighing 75kg would be approximately 2000 per day. This single pizza exceeds her entire day’s energy needs by 600 calories.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Over the course of 14000 calories available to her over a week  11400 remain after the pizza. This gives her an average of 1750 calories per day across the remaining 6.5 days to stay on track.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
If this necessary reduction isn’t appreciated and 2000 calories are eaten across each of the remaining days in the week  around 1600 excess calories will be eaten  15600   equating to between 0.4-0.5lbs of body fat. Over a month  2lbs of body fat. Over a year  24lbs of body fat. The pizza is not inherently fattening  but failure to adjust overall diet can be.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Over time  a pizza of any caloric representation can absolutely be part of a supportive diet  but in the event of ultra caloric density  frequency of consumption will be highly relevant to outcomes. If consumed often  calorie reduction across other meals will be important.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
If Michael enjoys a Pizza Hut pepperoni pizza  he must eat it. But by switching the 13” version for the same 9” version  Michael could enjoy the exact same tastes and textures  but half his calorie intake from 2232 to 1092  which is still relatively excessive in calories.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
If Michael enjoys this pizza once a week  that’s 1140 calories saved. Over a month  4560. And a year  54720 calories and could be the difference between losing or gaining approximately 15lbs of body fat.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
If your pizza enjoyment is more sporadic  it will have less influence on overall body weight. Additionally  skilful adjustment of calorie intake in order to facilitate inclusion of your favourite pizza may be the happy middle ground that caters for long term compositional and mental success. ⁣⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣
This is true. But there is one small caveat that is conveniently left unmentioned. The caveat is that whilst more fat is burned  this is merely the wheelbarrows of dietary fat consumed  not body fat. Because body fat is governed by total energy in vs out  irrespective of the macronutrient ratio consumed. ⁣⁣⁣

Arguing that eliminating a macronutrient that contains 4 calories per gram  only to replace the same volume of food with a macronutrient with 9 calories per gram as a fat loss intervention could easily be called out by a 7 year old as chaotic molestation of basic fat loss science - eating fewer calories than you expend. ⁣⁣⁣

Though reduction in body fat is the direct result of consuming fewer calories than we expend  it is our decisions that ultimately define our adherence to this caloric deficit. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
In the cases of the muffin  cinnamon bun   cacao brownie  all items contain a few bites of food.

Consuming moderate calories from drinks forms part of a balanced  flexible diet which would be compromised if one was savagely instructed to source all future drinking experiences from water. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
In fact  if infrequent  it is likely that consuming 1032 calories from a milkshake  or 400-600 calories from a coffee based drink can fit any dietary adherence. But if consumption is frequent  each episode accounts for large chunks of overall daily energy intake  likely raising overall calorie intake over time once food is also consumed. Such beverages may also accompany hyper calorie dense fast food.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Compensating for such choices appears possible. Though in some cases  significant reduction of food based calories will be required to maintain conscious or unconscious caloric outcomes when such drinks are regularly consumed.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
In a study by DiMeglio   Mattes  they found that after drinking calorie inclusive beverages  subjects didn’t enact the same dietary compensation as they did after eating isocaloric loads of solid food. The compensation for the latter was eating fewer calories for their next meal. ⁣⁣⁣

In this example  reducing the pasta portion and seizing am opportunity to swap the pesto and cheese for lower volumes of reduced calorie versions still allow for a significant enough portion to produce a tasty meal  but a caloric value that is also likely to support adherence to a calorie deficit. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
As much as calorie dense foods require diligence  one can also realise that foods relatively low in calories  such as vegetables  will seldom require the same. High volumes can be consumed at little caloric expense. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Your diet does not have to be turned on it’s head. Taking advantage the countless  easy opportunities available will allow you to keep eating the food you enjoy whilst still achieving your compositional goals. Information is power. ⁣⁣⁣

5572,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Of all three macronutrients  protein is the one we often strive to consume more of.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Thus  consuming protein dense snacks can serve as an elementary intervention to boost daily protein intake conveniently. Wise to this  many brands have taken it upon themselves to market protein versions of already popular snacks  such as chocolate bars   bite size treats.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
But although the protein labelling on the wrapper may be appropriate within snickers HQ in that their ‘protein’ version contains 10g of protein compared to 4.6g in their original bar  this protein increase of 5.4g doesn’t mean much for populations requiring upward of 20g. It also comes at nearly 3x the cost of an original snickers bar. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If such products are enjoyed and financial means are available  such products must be consumed. But there exist alternative interventions that satisfy taste  offer significantly higher protein and require less financial outlay. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
For example  one could enjoy a smaller version of the original chocolate bar they enjoy more whilst accompanying it with a cost effective  protein rich snack they enjoy  such as low fat Greek yogurt and berries .⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Upon realisation  spending  1.25 per day to consume 9g of extra protein from graze protein bites may appear unwise when compared to spending  0.39 on low fat cheese they enjoy  consuming double the protein   nearly half the calories in the process.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Misleading protein marketing is compounded when calorie dense foods like peanut butter and bread offer the same amount of protein  7x less cost and fewer calories than a heavily marketed ‘protein’ chocolate bar. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Whilst there are some snacks that justify their protein marketing and convenience with offerings of 20-25g of protein per bar/shake  it is upon you to analyse the label to check exactly how protein dense/cost effective the snack is.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Brands will continue to capitalise on the protein trend  despite not satisfying your protein needs. Make sure you are aware that alternative  enjoyable opportunities exist. They offer more protein  similar convenience and less cost.⁣⁣

Though I had heard of Herbalife and did intrinsically question the woman’s failure to mention the name of her company  I agreed to meet her for more information about the job.⁣⁣⁣⁣

3 days later when I entered the room  my heart sank. Herbalife. Everywhere. Looking back  I wish I ignored the onlooking beatlejuice eyes before destroying the Herbalife product stand with one crisp haymaker. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

What unfolded over the next 2 hours will haunt me until the end of my days. I witnessed a presentation which included a grown man being reduced to tears because Herbalife had apparently ‘cured his cancer’. Dozens of brainwashed individuals answered rhetorically preached questions with nodding heads in enthusiastic unison. I wasn’t at a job interview  I was at a rally.

Cinema’s are purposefully designed so you must walk past the food before you go in  and on occasion only sell tickets at the food stalls. Thus  sometimes the delicious items can be just too tempting to ignore.

If one frequents the cinema 6 times in 6 weeks and consumes 6567 calories across those visits  sacrifice is likely required across the rest of their diet to adhere to the status quo.

If cinema visits  and accompanying eating episodes of this style occur even more frequently  they make entry into a caloric surplus more likely.

As you are at the cinema to watch the movie  understanding that you can enjoy the exact same food  but in a smaller portions can result in consuming significantly fewer calories if opportunities are taken. This way you still indulge  but also satisfy your desires and support your compositional goals too.

5577,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Most logical theories or approaches have  at one point in time  been misunderstood or miscommunicated  resulting in the original theory becoming inconsistent.⁣
⁣
In the case of the flexible diet and what it hopes to achieve  poor communication has rendered it different to what it originated as. ⁣
⁣
These days  many believe flexible dieting is quite literally eating anything as long as it fits the calorie target for a compositional goal  resulting in a diet potentially void of nutrients  despite being calorically and macro-nutritionally sound. But while caloric adherence is fundamental to compositional outcomes  the type of food you eat is also relevant in the long term. ⁣
⁣
The basis of most supportive diets centre around eating nutritious  filling foods most of the time under the realm of caloric control. The original theory of supplementing with flexibility was intended to allow intelligent inclusion of less supportive foods as part of the overall diet with limited damage. ⁣
⁣
Therefore  the original ‘flexible diet’ never intended to be one that promoted heavy consumption of low quality food under the guise of ‘health’. Its intention was to recognize that eating nutrients are important  but that sometimes eating less nutrients for the purpose of enjoyment is just as important. ⁣
⁣
By making flexible choices that encourage supportive food behaviours  desired composition and enjoyment  all aspects of physical and mental health can be satisfied indefinitely. It is quite literally the dietary definition of balance. ⁣
⁣
It is only when you step back and look at the whole picture over time that you fully recognize your progress. If your diet and mind is flexible  it allows you to fully commit to your dietary goals  but also  on occasion enrich the joy in your life  knowing that getting back on track is easy  and progress is inevitable. ⁣

For the rest of us  they serve as outstanding sources of energy containing vitamins  minerals  fibre and water. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Some have more sugar  others have less. Some have more calories  others have less. And some have more nutrients   fibre  whilst others have less. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
It is worth noting that sugar extracted from fruit  vegetables and pulses will have the same metabolic culmination as sugar extracted from a snickers. But the combination of sugar and fibre in the aforementioned makes them more likely to satisfy hunger more than lower fibre  processed foods.⁣⁣

The micronutrients listed under items account for those high on each’s RDA  recommended daily allowance . A term coined to define the estimated amount of nutrients considered necessary for marshaling a supportive diet. ⁣⁣⁣

Using 100g of carrots as an example. Consumption will result in 140  of an average adult’s vitamin A RDA. 200g of regular potatoes   40  of their vitamin C RDA. And 75g of spinach   430  of their vitamin K RDA and 25  of their mangenese RDA. These are small portions of one ingredient out of several ingredients consumed each day. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣
It is recommended that we consume between 25-30g of fibre per day to optimize gut health and help prevent risk of developing conditions like colon cancer. Foods abundant in fibre also digest slower and tend to satiate us. Like protein  burning more calories when metabolized and helping prevent us from overeating. ⁣

⁣⁣⁣⁣
Most fast food is convenient and hyper palatable. These are the cornerstones of your decision to pursue them. Most of this food is inherently calorie dense. Therefore  if  you regularly consume high amounts  the possibility of being overweight increases. Most whole food is not as convenient  hyper palatable or calorie dense. And the literature shows that most successful controlled diets are based on whole foods. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
However  be sure to know that being overweight is not because of calorie dense fast food  but one’s management of it. Overall dietary intake  including portion selection and energy expenditure will dictate one’s inherent compositional outcomes. Not ‘a McDonald’s’.⁣⁣⁣⁣

If you enjoy fast food  you must eat it. This post illuminates how selection of different options can result in significantly different energy intakes over time. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

⁣
But subjective opinions of such foods and drinks may lead us to irrational mindsets  believing that regular socializing  and the foods and drinks consumed  will always be catastrophic for our composition.⁣
⁣⁣
It doesn’t have to be. The main reason we select such foods  if privileged to do so  is down to our adoration towards them. This should never change. Your social calendar does need to be confined to the misery of non-existence whilst embarking on a conscious journey to compositional change. ⁣
⁣
No single food is detrimental to any goal. Instead  understanding portion size and regularity of consumption within the DJ text of overall dietary intake is more useful.⁣
⁣⁣
The notion of totalitarian restriction bringing compositional rewards can be disproven by the virtue of spending 18 seconds analyzing nutritional information of ‘social’ foods. Additionally  how they fair alongside the context of our overall dietary goals. ⁣⁣

18 seconds sacrificed to surface factual  practical information can save a lifetime of haphazard  incorrect perceptions about the food we eat and how it can benefit our mental health and happiness  without impairing our physical health. We need not suffer. ⁣

Armed with knowledge  seem-less swaps can be selected and practical sensibility of portion size can be realised. And if calorie excess is desired  which it will be at times  adjusting nutritional intake either side of the episode to facilitate indulgence is also a smart  logical way to replace useless feelings of guilt with solid  literal  evidence.⁣

⁣⁣⁣
If this meaning is applied to the context of food  many will have obtained pre-existing perceptions about the food they eat. Such as the caloric insignificance of enjoying a coffee based drink and a chocolate muffin with a friend  compared to a seemingly calamitous binge eating episode featuring 4 chocolate based snacks. Yet in this specific example  if erroneous perception prevails  the insignificant coffee and few impromptu nibbles of the muffin will result in consumption of nearly double the calories.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
In a similar thought  the idea of consuming half packet of biscuits or two donuts will likely appear detrimental to compositional goals if repeated regularly - and with valid reason. Yet the proposition of drinking a coffee and 3 biscuits appears intrinsically more supportive to caloric control. Alas  in this example  it is not. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Any collection of food can fit any goal in isolation. What occurs over weeks  months and years will define compositional and functional outcomes. It must be said that these coffees are large portions with whole milk. Smaller portions with low fat milks will reduce caloric volume.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Of course  there are abundances of calorie sparse  nutritious  fibre rich foods which are more likely to physically nourish and satiate - these positive perceptions inadvertently mean such foods are less likely to be open to erroneous perceptions. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
But in the case of calorie dense  nutrient sparse foods  obtaining factual information about the them may result in more supportive decisions and behaviours. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
To conclude  this is not a call to consume some numerous chocolate bars  biscuits and donuts. These are merely caloric examples of seemingly nightmare nutritional scenarios compared to our often innocuous perception of the scenarios on the left. ⁣⁣⁣

An example can easily be found in those idolizing their favourite sports team  whilst demonizing that team’s bitter rival. Yet  if put into non-emotional  neutral context  both teams are merely trying to beat each other by the same means.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
We idolize some foods because we believe them to be ‘better’ for us - we want affirmation that our consumption is correct. We demonize other foods because we believe they are ‘worse’ for us - we want affirmation that consuming these foods is incorrect. But in isolation  no food is correct or incorrect  it’s just different. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
In this example we have avocado on brown bread and Nutella on white bread. The former is often idolized  whilst the latter is usually demonised or associated with guilt. Yet in this example  consumption of the former means enjoyment  more nutrients and fibre  but also more calories. Whereas consumption of the latter means enjoyment  less nutrients and fibre  but in this example  significantly fewer calories.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Therefore the avocado toast may be a good idea if the goal is to consume more nutrients and potentially enhance satiety  but the Nutella toast may support calorie reduction as it is fewer in calories. These outcomes ultimately depend on overall dietary intake. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Sometimes our unwillingness to consider what we don’t believe in  known as confirmation bias  take us away from what is actually true.

You consume it  it passes through your esophagus  then enters the stomach before entering the small intestine. At this point energy and nutrients are absorbed and passed into the bloodstream. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

The calories in fast food are made up of protein  carbs and fat. The carbs will go directly into the bloodstream or be stored in the liver as glycogen  leftovers are stored as fat.

The protein is broken down into peptides which become amino acids which build protein stores. Excess amino acids are excreted or stored as body fat. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

⁣
If the frequency of calorie excessive nights out is low  the caloric impact on body composition will follow suit. But if such episodes are regular  despite lasting just a few hours  they can heavily influence body composition over time.⁣
⁣
Whilst a night out is there to be enjoyed  one will likely spend the subsequent 24 hours in a state of fatigue and reduced motivation to move and/or adhere to eating protocols which support their goal. This can extend the unsupportive few hours anticipated in the night out to another day of unsupportive behaviours. ⁣
⁣
If you have a fat loss calorie target of 1800 calories per day  12600 per week   the night out and subsequent day accumulates to around 3/4 of the total weekly calories required to achieve the goal. ⁣
⁣
Even if you began meticulously adhering to your 1800 calorie target over the next week  you would would still be consuming significantly more weekly calories than required because of the excessive 24 hour period.⁣
⁣
Given the short-term caloric ferocity of these episodes and their effect on the big picture  it’s easy to see why many may be confused as to why they aren’t progressing if they adhere to their caloric needs 90  of the time. ⁣

Instead of wondering why no progress is being made  it’s your prerogative to find out why. Then you can make sensible adjustments that have the smallest impact on enjoyment  but the biggest impact on progression. In this case  the minor tweaks displayed on the right side of my graphics.⁣

Charlatans who tweet that ‘macronutrients are dumb’ and that energy balance is ‘outdated’ use these persuasive nouns to deflate the significance of energy balance. This is to manipulate uneducated people into believing their invented falsehoods and gibberish dieting methods. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Gravity  discovered in 1687  is one of the most groundbreaking discoveries within humankind. It’s efficacy remains robust to this day  despite its discovery centuries ago. Energy balance will follow suit. ⁣⁣

Just because absorbing different macronutrients results in varying caloric availability  it does not mean you need to throw out the entire principle. Doing so would be like saying gravity doesn’t exist because airplanes fly.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
As you can see  protein has a notably higher thermic effect than carbs and fats  resulting in greater energy expenditure and fewer overall ‘net’ calories consumed. But in spite of this  calories in vs out is still entirely applicable to the outcome. There is simply a greater energy expenditure during the process which elevates TDEE. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Over time  energy balance can change when calories are equated  but this is because of different macros within those calories. It is why high protein diets result in greater energy expenditure  maintenance of muscle tissue and satiety. All of which affect the balance of energy. This is why acquiring sufficient protein  between 1-2g per kg of bodyweight  may support multitudinous health   compositional goals.⁣
⁣⁣
Given most foods contain multiple macros  measuring total calories consumed is still a very accurate method to appreciate total energy intake.⁣⁣

5591,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"As human beings  we are social creatures. While interaction with friends and family can take place via multitudes of varying activities  enjoying dinner out is a popular option for many of us.⁣
⁣
The main reason we frequent restaurants is ultimately to select items of food we enjoy the taste of. This objective should always remain ahead of selecting items that you think you ought to choose for compositional or functional goals. ⁣
⁣
In fact  if you frequent restaurants and eateries irregularly  the influence the odd calorie dense  processed inclusive meal has on your overall goal over time  is inconsequentially minuscule. Thus  it’s data does not need to be appreciated as consciously. ⁣
⁣
But if restaurant visits are regular and compositional goals are sought  specifically fat loss   success may be blunted by the fact that many delicious restaurant foods also happen to be calorie dense  ultra in some cases . Thus  high intake of  ultra  calorie dense food can undermine necessary caloric reduction required to achieve said goals.⁣
⁣
Regularly consuming meals containing thousands of calories may destroy the possibility of achieving an average calorie deficit over time  or demand unsustainably extreme caloric adjustment across other meals to stay on track. ⁣
⁣
But as my graphic shows  there are opportunities to select similar foods  enjoy similar quantities and tastes  but crucially consume significantly fewer calories while enjoying social restaurant visits. And although I offer you just a tiny array of examples  the principe can be applied anywhere  any place  should the data be available.⁣
⁣
It must be remembered that the point of going out for dinner is not to track the calories you consume - it is to appreciate the company of friends and family  and enjoy your favourite foods. But if you are calmly informed on selections that may support your goals simultaneously  you can enjoy them more often  rich in the knowledge that they are helping you succeed. ⁣

5592,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"By definition  a carbohydrate is a biomolecule consisting of carbon  hydrogen and oxygen. It also happens to be an energy source. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
But over the last few decades  carbohydrates have been met with revulsion and/or fear. Mainly by those who sympathize with the notion consumption of carbs will make them fat  or prevent them from losing fat.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
The immediate problem with these claims is the mirky differentiation of carbohydrates as an entity within edible food. Pizza  pasta  chips  bread and pastry all fall inside the umbrella of “don’t eat it because its got carbs and you’ll get fat”. But if we examine the exact make-up of these foods we can see that carbohydrates are not the only macronutrient present. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
The examples displayed on the right of this graphic represent foods containing calories from carbs  protein and more pertinently  fat - which houses over double the caloric density. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Fat contains 9 calories per gram  compared to 4 calories per gram within protein and carbs respectively. Therefore  the presence of protein and fat  via additional ingredients  within food will increase its overall caloric worth. Calorie balance  of any macronutrient ratio  determines body composition. Not carbs. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
The futility of the ‘carbs make you fat’ argument is compelled by the fact that fruit and vegetables are mostly made up of carbohydrates. Therefore by persecuting carbs in such generic terms  one would be inadvertently claiming that broccoli or blueberries make you fat. This ridiculous claim is aptly dispelled by the outcome of the ‘rice reduction diet’ experiment  swipe left . ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
The body of evidence  see last slide as an example  shows that body fat has and always will be about the balance of energy  irrespective of carb consumption. Cutting out carbs may create a calorie deficit  but the same applies if fat and protein are removed and/or energy expenditure is increased. ⁣⁣

5593,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"There is an obvious irony that common  inexpensive household items such as bread and milk contain as much  or more  protein than expensive products heavily centred around protein marketing. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
One’s desire for protein density is usually virtue of knowledge that diets relatively high in protein are advantageous across an array of health and fitness goals. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Fat loss can be supported by the elevated levels of satiety achieved from sufficient protein consumption. Muscle gain can occur though optimal protein synthesis. And general well-being/repairing of tissues/support of bodily functions can be optimized. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Wise to this  a multitude of brands have created ‘protein’ versions of existing products to appeal to those intent on consuming protein for goal related purposes. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
If one is on a journey of nutritional optimisation  protein consumption will likely be relatively high. But as you can see  the word itself  presented in large font  does not necessarily make that product a justifiable choice.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Because upon evaluating actual protein content  alongside consideration of additional matters of importance such as cost and caloric value  buying items on the basis of a word can become pointless. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
For example  though one may be bedazzled by a cereal bar boasting protein content on it’s label  realising that its protein value is equivalent to  and nearly 10x the price  of a non marketed single slice of seeded bread may lead them to reconsider their purchase. ⁣⁣⁣
Given that all choices incrementally accumulate towards overall protein intake  any marketed choice should be consumed if enjoyed. But rest assured  there exist non marketed items which contain equivalent  or more protein at a fraction of the cost.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Protein is essential. But it is fairly clear that items are being designed by brands who aim to cash in on a hugely beneficial macronutrient. It may be in your interest to consider the legitimate protein sources that don’t grab the exaggerated headlines.⁣⁣⁣

Enjoyment aside  it is easy to see how consumption of multiple biscuits and cookies in short periods of time can quickly contribute to excessive caloric consumption.

The essence appears sound in that waiting for hunger and satiety cue’s before and during eating is helpful. But the first major issue arrives as soon as the hunger is dealt with. Whilst hunger has been intuitively nurtured  the extent of energy consumed is largely unaccounted for.⁣⁣

Thus  the effect on composition is unknown  and possibly counter productive given the ease at which calorie dense  hyper palatable foods can be excessively eaten. ⁣⁣

⁣⁣
Ironically  tracking calories is not the prison sentence many portray it as. It is essentially a temporary acquisition of objective data that can allow you to make skilled  intuitively supportive decisions for the rest of your life.

⁣
Let’s transfer this idea to small items of food such as nuts  millionaire shortbread  smoothies  avocado and regular beef mince.

Rather than demonizing ourselves for eating these items  we must hold them in the same perspective as all foods we consume. Because all food is equal in that we should first and foremost allow ourselves access to any food we enjoy. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The disconnect between error and reality is entangled in assumption. While some may be correct  others are resoundingly wrong. Deeming regular  small amounts of mayonnaise and dressings as too insignificant to be worthy of consideration  but labelling a pizza as ruining the hard yards of dieting  illuminate exactly why assumptions do not truly inform us  and why data  perspective and the context of time does. Assumed threats to our composition can in fact be nearly identical  or less detrimental than assumed insignificances. ⁣
⁣⁣
As ever  the point here revolves around awareness. Know that eating patterns facilitate or inhibit progress over time. Quantity of calories  not type of food  is the direct driver of compositional change. Over time  small dietary tweaks  the result of knowledge  can reap big long-term rewards.⁣⁣

5606,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"For those intending to reduce overall caloric intake in order to reduce fat  these calorie saving meat swaps may provide you with several easy opportunities. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
One immediate observation with these meat sources is that most of the lower calorie alternatives are higher in protein. For example  200g chicken drumstick gets 144 of its calories from protein and the remaining 316 from fat. Whereas the skinless chicken breast gets 192 of its calories from protein and the remaining 18 from fat. Thus  the breast has significantly higher protein density per calorie. ⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
As there are no carbohydrates present in fresh meat - the calories will always derive from protein or fat. If the calorie value is high  but the protein value is low  it means the meat is high in fat. Fat is not to be feared  but it contains 9 calories per gram  over double the caloric density of protein and carbs. Thus  foods high in fat are relatively high in calories. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
All meats can of course be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet. But if consumed regularly whilst pursuing a calorie deficit for fat loss  you may want to consider more items on the right hand side. After all  you’ll still be experiencing the same volume of food  very similar tastes  but significantly fewer calories which supports a calorie deficit.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Small  effortless changes accumulate over time to produce a bigger result. Why  Because they were so easy to maintain that you kept doing them.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Making the above 9 swaps across 9 varied meals would enable you to save 1491 calories  enjoy the same volume  taste   increase protein intake. Across 90 meals  you’d save nearly 15 000 calories... And so on. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
These swaps offer a practical   enjoyable opportunity for you to significantly alter your calorie intake to support your goal without the overwhelming hassle of planned dietary upheaval or extreme restriction of foods you enjoy. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

Your self worth cannot be defined by your weight because the number you see on the scales merely describes your entire mass’ relationship with the ground. It cannot decide whether you are worthy of love or acceptance. It is a number. ⁣

It is a travesty that large organizations make tens of millions of pounds each year by publicly admonishing their members for not losing weight  whilst offering pitiful advice in return. The sad and nonsensical result is attachment between weight and self worth. ⁣
⁣
If weight has been gained it must be viewed through two lenses. First  objectivity. Gaining weight is merely the result of consuming more calories than we expend over time. If we wish  we can reverse this. But weighing less simply means just that. It does not  and never will make us more worthy. Second  compassion.

By removing these enjoyed snacks from your diet you  you’re also removing joy. As you grind through an ultra restrictive  low calorie diet you hate  it’s only a matter of time before it either ends  or you end it early because you can’t take another day of it. ⁣
⁣
The irony is that once the ultra restrictive diet ends  the likelihood of overeating calorie dense snacks increases  leading to regaining weight  and the misery you grinded through was pointless. ⁣
⁣
Further irony presents itself in the proposition of including biscuits  donuts  pastries and chocolate regularly in your diet  alongside nutritious meals of course   only sourcing lower calorie alternatives or adjusting portion size can combine your calorie deficit  the thing you need for fat loss   with enjoyment  the thing you need for long term fat loss . ⁣

Thus  as my slides show  foods lazily deemed out of bounds by useless fitness professionals  can simply be swapped for similar versions you enjoy that present lower caloric density.⁣
⁣
For example  not all assortments of 13 biscuits amount to 1244 calories. Some may offer less than half that figure. Not all Nutella or peanut butter toast must be over 500 calories  that figure can be halved and taste just as good. This principle stretches across all foods  not least donuts  pastries  nuts  chocolate and yogurt.⁣

One could argue that micronutrient rich whole foods in their original form are on average lower in calories than their heavily processed counterparts. However  confirming this statement can only be confirmed when looking at the information of an individual food. Because nutritious food can also be calorie dense. ⁣⁣⁣

Changing body composition may be helped by underlying principles such as eating satiating foods and balancing macronutrients  but the overall determinant is our management of total energy in via food and beverages  and out via BMR  non exercise activity thermogenesis  planned exercise activity thermogenesis and the thermic effect of food.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
Whilst micronutrients and energy represent different spheres of inclusive health management  they can be nurtured simultaneously. Thus  here are two lists of micronutrient dense foods  one relatively low  and one relatively high in caloric worth.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣
In the second slide  the caloric density arrives in the form of high volumes of beneficial fats or sugar dense sources of micronutrients/fibre. And whilst satiety from these is more likely than a bag of sweets  it is not guaranteed and portion sizes may require moderation. ⁣⁣⁣

Instead  it is simply a selection of food from some of the world’s favourite fast food chains. This post is therefore an objective arrangement of basic nutritional information. Swipe left to see more lists.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
The establishments included in this post have existed for decades. This is undoubtedly because it is abundantly clear that millions continue to enjoy consumption of such food. And whilst most items within these lists are not particularly nutrient dense  they are still legitimate items of food which should be eaten if enjoyed. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Instead of basing opinion on subjective metaphors and closed minded assumptions that fast food will send us to hospital  it is more useful to consider a more logical approach. Correlation of consumption in relation to regularity and overall dietary intake is a more worthwhile way to gauge the effect of fast food on one’s overall health. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
The early 2000s brought about mass hysteria regarding fast food and it’s negative effect on health. But most references were anecdotal  open to infinite nuance and disregarded a plethora of relevant variables under preconditioned bias. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

One example can be found in the ‘Supersize Me’ experiment/documentary in 2004. It professed the negative impact McDonald’s had on the subject’s health. But the subject consumed nothing but McDonald’s food for one whole month. Whilst the findings may have been accurate  they are rendered as entirely useless to those who do not consume 90  McDonald’s meals per month.

Ironically  whilst brand showcase their innocence or nakedness  unmodified  fresh fruit is already the epitome of these marketed slogans. It already contains micronutrients and already hydrates.

For others  particularly those who intend to change their composition  a pizza can still be a pizza. But depending on amounts of certain ingredients used  the calorie value can be very different from one pizza to the next. ⁣
⁣
For example  in my graphic both pizzas are roughly the same circumference and include the same tastes and textures. By reducing the volume of calorie dense ingredients such as the pizza base  cheese and pepperoni  it reduces the calorie value of the pizza  but still offers as many tasty elements. ⁣
⁣
If fat loss is the aim  a calorie deficit is the requirement. Therefore  if opportunities such as lower calorie pizza bases  cheese and yogurt are available  it may be wise to seize them. This way you can enjoy the same tastes and similar overall volume. ⁣
⁣
Understanding the importance of protein for fat loss  and many other health   fitness goals  may lead you to increase volume of low calorie  high protein foods such as chicken  in this example  to aid satiety  and reduce high calorie  lower protein foods such as pepperoni to moderate calories  in this example .⁣

Moving unhelpful marketing and moral biases aside  if one was to analyse the factual nutritional components of each cereal they would conclude that each 50g serving of cereal is relatively calorie dense and shares virtual equality in caloric worth. They could then see that protein  fibre and sugar values are similar when compared. ⁣⁣

Even if one’s moral cereal code was defined by beliefs that their choice included more healthful nutritional variables  such beliefs remain largely unproven by virtue of the more objective nutrition label and calm perspectives of a bowl of cereal’s dietary influence on overall diet. ⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣⁣
There exist few dietary goals and compositional targets which do not benefit from sufficient protein consumption. Whether it is the basic repairing of cells  rebuilding of muscle tissue  or adherence to composition change  protein is essential for all human beings.⁣⁣⁣⁣

If we seek to evaluate the relationship between protein  as a valuable element in our diet  and calorie intake  as a pertinent element in our composition   this graph helps show protein dense foods. These foods are are relatively low in caloric value  yet simultaneously high in protein value. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Per 100g  we can see that most sources of protein dense foods are animal based in the form of lean meat  poultry  fish  seafood and low fat dairy. But there are also plant based exceptions to this general pattern  while grains and nuts’ protein density is collectively the lowest.⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Some may embark on a determined quest to consume high amounts of protein because they heard through the grapevine that it will definitely aid their fitness goal. But as my graphics show  The Fitness Chef copyright for all those who steal this post   some quests to achieve protein targets may result in consumption of excessive calories if the latter is ignored. Nuts and seeds are often lauded as protein sources  but while this is correct  achieving meaningful protein doses of 20-30g comes at the cost of several hundred calories absorbed from a low volume of food.⁣

Relatively high inclusion of protein dense foods allows us to increase satiety  amplifying adherence to caloric control. Thermic effect of metabolizing protein means that more energy is used to break it down compared to carbs and fats.⁣⁣⁣

Most food on earth contains protein. Some are dense and some are sparse. But its mere presence in any dose is enough encouragement for organisations to plaster it all over their packaging.

Rice aside  fibre may be the one main nutritional difference between these carb based foods. Whilst there is more fibre the less refined foods  thus offering more likelihood of satiety  this is not guaranteed. Because despite feeling fuller  we can still choose to eat more. Furthermore  we need to appreciate additional foods consumed across overall diet and energy expenditure.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
A diet rich in fibre is advised to support overall health  gut in particular. In terms of composition  it boils down to the same thing again - energy balance. As you can see  there is marginal difference in calories between the potatoes  rice  pasta or bread. Body composition is defined by how we manage our overall energy  regardless of the food type. ⁣⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣⁣
Despite the mirage of myths castrating one to believe they have a ‘broken metabolism’ or are ‘eating too little’  there is always a scientific reason why fat loss does not occur. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
The increasingly popular 1200 calorie number is likely derived from a website that allows the user to select the amount of weight they want to lose per week. As one is likely to select the highest possible amount of weight loss per week  a drastically low number is usually the result. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣⁣
The scientific answer for those who believe they are consuming low amounts of calories and not losing fat is simple. Regardless of ambition or belief  the individual is simply not adhering to a calorie deficit.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Underestimating portion sizes  forgetting consumptions  setting calorie targets too low resulting in binges or grazes and unintentionally decreasing voluntary   involuntary energy expenditure are a few reasons. But admonishment should not be the prescription by coaches - empathy and education should be.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
One does not need to count calories to lose or gain weight  but all calories consumed will determine that individual’s weight over time. With this in mind  accuracy is important. Especially if it provides you with liberating knowledge to achieve something you’ve been trying to do for years. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

“I’m losing weight  but I’m eating more that ever before” is a popular dieting statement that may confuse some. This is mainly because it’s usually born out of the false belief that consuming specific ‘elixir’ superfoods elicit greater fat loss. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
This notion is of course  impossible. In scientific terms  an individual must be in a state of caloric deficit for fat loss to occur in the first instance.

Thus  you are eating higher volumes of food  but fewer total calories.⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
As a caloric deficit is the only way fat loss can occur  reducing calorie intake may be difficult for an individual seeking fat loss. Not least because it requires a change in dietary habits and behaviours. Therefore  it makes perfect sense to consume a relatively high volume of food in order to remain satiated and reduce risk of excessive calorie consumption. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

When an individual embarks on fat loss  each of the above are important. One must enjoy their energy consumption  be aware of energy intake in relation to their energy output  and consistently ensure that they are in an average state of caloric deficit over time. ⁣

To ensure progress  one may have to change and adjust their dietary habits. But instead of completely radicalising the diet  adherence to change may be more likely if change is subtle.

⁣
Graze protein bites contain less protein  more calories and cost fifteen times more than 75g uncooked pasta.⁣
⁣
These short statements apply to varying degrees across the rest of the protein marketed items in my graphic. But whilst this may be the case  if they are enjoyed  they must be eaten  despite the expense and exaggerated marketing  culminating in disappointing amounts of protein.
⁣
Some of the items on the right of my graphic such as cheese and milk represent protein rich snacks  serving as less expensive solutions to boosting protein throughout the day at similar  or lower caloric cost.⁣
⁣
Other items included such as pasta  beans  peas  cottage cheese and lentils serve as ingredients that can be deployed in main meals to boost overall protein with relative ease throughout the day. This leaves more scope to include snacks void of exaggerated protein claims like regular chocolate bars similar in caloric load  much lower in cost and that you likely enjoy more.⁣
⁣
Many bemoan their inability to achieve protein targets per day. In the example of one trying to achieve a target of 130g protein per day  protein abundant sources like meat  poultry  fish  dairy and eggs could offer 30g protein servings on their own across three meals. But this still leaves 40g yet to achieve.⁣
⁣
Instead of dreading another chicken breast for a late supper  understanding that additional sources lower in protein density can still accumulate to achieve the target. For example  4 low fat cheeses for a snack  150g peas and 75g pasta added to meals provides the extra 40g protein at the cost of 569 calories and just  0.77. ⁣
⁣
Being informed enables you to enrich your decisions with calm decisiveness which serves to support adherence to your goals. You are then able to cut through marketing ploys  instead understanding that  over time  forgotten treasures will serve to achieve greater outcomes at significantly less financial outlay. ⁣

5637,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Our perception is often that eating main meals results in acquiring more calories when compared to drinking beverages.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
This is undoubtedly because  in main  it does. In fact  there exist significantly more foods/recipe combinations containing higher calories than most drinks. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Consuming moderate calories from drinks forms part of a balanced  flexible diet which would be compromised if one was savagely instructed to source all future drinking experiences from water. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In fact  if infrequent  it is likely that consuming 1002 calories from a milkshake  or 400-500 calories from a coffee based drink can fit any dietary adherence. But if consumption is frequent  each episode accounts for large chunks of overall daily energy intake  likely raising overall calorie intake over time once food is also consumed. Such beverages may also accompany hyper calorie dense fast food.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Compensating for such choices appears possible. Though in some cases  significant reduction of food based calories will be required to maintain conscious or unconscious caloric outcomes when such drinks are regularly consumed.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In a study by DiMeglio   Mattes  they found that after drinking calorie inclusive beverages  subjects didn’t enact the same dietary compensation as they did after eating isocaloric loads of solid food. The compensation for the latter was eating fewer calories for their next meal. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
When compared to significant eating episodes such as a main meal  the true caloric ferocity of certain drinks illuminates. Whilst meals can satisfy hunger  contain micronutrients and enjoyment  aside from enjoyment  the same cannot be said for most beverages akin to the ones shown here. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Milkshakes and Frappuccino’s aside  instructing or shaming one to immediately omit potential dietary hindrances is not wise. But informing and objectively explaining why it may be a hindrance empowers individuals to educate and steer themselves towards dietary change. Something that is altogether more powerful. ⁣⁣

5638,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Though calorie dense  if pizza is enjoyed  it must be eaten. But as my graphic shows  enjoying ‘a pizza’ proposes many different nutritional scenarios.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
A large takeaway pizza can contain up to 2600 calories. Put into context  the calories needed to maintain body weight for a lightly active 35 year old  5ft 7 woman  weighing 75kg would be approximately 2000 per day. This single pizza exceeds her entire day’s energy needs by 600 calories.⁣
⁣⁣
Over the course of 14000 calories available to her over a week  11400 remain after the pizza. This gives her an average of 1750 calories per day across the remaining 6.5 days to stay on track.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If this necessary reduction isn’t appreciated and 2000 calories are eaten across each of the remaining days in the week  around 1600 excess calories will be eaten  15600   equating to between 0.4-0.5lbs of body fat. Over a month  2lbs of body fat. Over a year  24lbs of body fat. The pizza is not inherently fattening  but failure to adjust overall diet can be.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Over time  a pizza of any caloric representation can absolutely be part of a supportive diet  but in the event of ultra caloric density  frequency of consumption will be highly relevant to outcomes. If consumed often  calorie reduction across other meals will be important.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If Michael enjoys a Pizza Hut pepperoni pizza  he must eat it. But by switching the 13” version for the same 9” version  Michael could enjoy the exact same tastes and textures  but half his calorie intake from 2232 to 1092  which is still relatively excessive in calories.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If Michael enjoys this pizza once a week  that’s 1140 calories saved. Over a month  4560. And a year  54720 calories and could be the difference between losing or gaining approximately 15lbs of body fat.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If one’s pizza enjoyment is more sporadic  it will have less influence on overall body weight. Additionally  skilful adjustment of calorie intake in order to facilitate inclusion of one’s favourite pizza may be the happy middle ground that caters for compositional and mental success. ⁣⁣

5640,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Like any fat loss based dietary intervention conjured from human desperation  the keto diet instructs its host to eliminate rather than evaluate. In this case  by eradicating most sources of carbohydrates and replacing them with dietary fats. As a result  Keto fanatics will opportunistically convince you that doing so will burn more fat. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
This is true. But there is one small caveat that is conveniently left unmentioned. The caveat is that whilst more fat is burned  this is merely the wheelbarrows of dietary fat consumed  not body fat. Because body fat is governed by total energy in vs out  irrespective of the macronutrient ratio consumed. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Though some refuse to accept it  fat loss can only occur if in a state of caloric deficit. Thus  the comparisons in my post illuminate the farcical  counterproductive concept that hardcore ketogenic proprietors continue to invest in.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Arguing that eliminating a macronutrient that contains 4 calories per gram  only to replace the same volume of food with a macronutrient with 9 calories per gram as a fat loss intervention could easily be called out by a 7 year old as chaotic molestation of basic fat loss science - eating fewer calories than you expend. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Like any method of eating  Keto is viable if it is enjoyed. And as a fat loss intervention  it is technically valid  but only if conducted alongside a calorie deficit - you see where this is going... ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Those who argue that fat loss can occur in a state of ketogenic caloric surplus are as deluded as any soul who believes that this avocado bun won’t slide around in your hands like a BMW in the snow. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Because that is impossible. And because there are numerous bodies of impartial literature  the latest by Hall   Guo 2018  stating that there is no difference between carb or fat rich diets regarding fat loss when calories are equated. ⁣⁣

To conclude  for fat loss  you do not need to eliminate any food from your diet  not least carbohydrates which contain many essential micronutrients fibre and mouthgasms.⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣
One can source protein from plants and animal produce. Though an entirely plant based diet provides some protein and abundances of micronutrients and fibre  those who chose to regularly eat animal produce will find it easier to acquire complete protein density per calorie/gram. And they can still can benefit from the nutritious qualities of plants.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Complete proteins are those which contain all essential  non reproductive amino acids in sufficient quantities. Food with incomplete proteins either don’t contain all essential amino acids or do not reach sufficient thresholds of them. ⁣Thus  specific combinations of plants are required to acquire complete proteins.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
By consuming animal based foods an individual would be consuming a complete protein source with all essential amino acids. Plant based foods are usually much lower in protein density and some amino acids can be absent. ⁣Thus  championing them as protein dense foods is overly ambitious. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Ferocious rhetoric linking meat consumption and disease usually fails to disclose that the evidence almost solely refers to processed meat. There is no compelling case against high quality  lean animal based foods.⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
If one feels passionately about avoiding animal products for ethical reasons  they must do so. But with acceptance that acquiring complete proteins with ease becomes harder.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
To reasonably conclude  despite plants being very important to overall health  there is no science proving that exclusively plant based diets are always more advantageous that diets including lean  high quality animal produce. Eating animal produce does not undo to benefits obtained from eating plants. ⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣
We have all heard tales about how a friend lost 2 stone in 2 months via extravagant or surprising means. In fictional fascination  we ignore the underlying reason the weight was lost - a calorie deficit.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
For example  the items of the left are calorie dense  therefore representing a small volume of food - and 2246 calories. Whereas the items on the right are still somewhat calorie dense  but represent a much higher volume of food per 1931 calories. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Per week one could watch their friend guzzle 3 tubs of ice cream  7 items of chocolate and 6 biscuits and believe that their own consumption of 1 ice cream tub  6 small bites and 3 tbsp of Nutella was inherently more supportive for reduction of body fat - due to consuming far smaller volumes of treat based food.⁣⁣

However  should ambitions stretch into the realms of composition  nutritional structures within food become relevant. As do behaviours and eating patterns. ⁣⁣

Though reduction in body fat is the direct result of consuming fewer calories than we expend  it is our decisions that ultimately define our adherence to this caloric deficit. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In the cases of the muffin  cinnamon bun   cacao brownie  all items contain a few bites of food.

⁣⁣
For someone requiring 2000 calories per day to maintain her weight  the items on the left represent approximately a quarter of their daily intake. Thus  regular consumptions of such caloric density may make their current weight harder to adhere to  irrespective of conscious efforts. ⁣⁣

If we consult the right side of my slides  there exists more eating episodes and similar volumes of food  but each is significantly lower in calories.

However  if all are combined into one ultra calorie dense eating episode  the often despairingly named cheat meal   it might be problematic for adherence to a sustainable  energy controlled diet.⁣
⁣⁣⁣
The above represents how quickly 3854 calories can be consumed. If an individual’s caloric goal was 2000 per day  this single eating episode all but double’s the daily calorie target. In comparison  virtually the same calorie intake can be achieved across 6 meals and 11 snacks. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Going moderately over or under calorie targets is normal. In fact  it adds to a fulfilling life. Sustainable adjustments in the days after excess can mean that the calorie target is still achieved on average over time. But the problem with regular over consumptions over short periods is that it makes the long term target much harder to achieve. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
For example  for the individual who has a deficit target of 2000 per day for fat loss  over the course of a week this accumulates to 14000 calories. After the meal above  they would be left with just over 10000 calories for the next 6.5 days. That’s around 1500 calories per day to still achieve the goal. Whilst this is possible  adherence becomes more difficult because one meal out of 21 per week contained more than 1/4 of weekly calories. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
If a meal like the one above is consumed rarely  the impact will be negligible. But if consumption is as regular as once per week  or more  it can impact progress. ⁣⁣

Because your composition is entirely dependant on the volumes of any given calorie source you choose to consume alongside the amount of energy you expend over a significant period of time.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Rather than fixating on the food type as the defining factor behind your compositional change  realising that the portion sizes of any food define such change reinforces the legitimacy of eating any enjoyed foods. ⁣⁣

Any food can still fit the goal. For example  one’s desire of cheesy pasta could result in an excessively high calorie meal  or meal more suited to the success of the goal. Using skills obtained  one can make slight adjustments to recipes which still cater for satisfying amounts of tasty food  but than also contain supportive portions of calories. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Weighing portions sizes of calorie dense ingredients allows you to realise you can continue to eat such ingredients regularly  but at more specific measurements. In this example  reducing the pasta portion and seizing am opportunity to swap the pesto and cheese for lower volumes of reduced calorie versions still allow for a significant enough portion to produce a tasty meal  but a caloric value that is also likely to support adherence to a calorie deficit. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
As much as calorie dense foods require diligence  one can also realise that foods relatively low in calories  such as vegetables  will seldom require the same. High volumes can be consumed at little caloric expense. ⁣⁣

Therefore the avocado toast may be a good idea if the goal is to consume more nutrients and potentially enhance satiety  but the Nutella toast may support calorie reduction as it is fewer in calories. These outcomes ultimately depend on overall dietary intake. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Sometimes our unwillingness to consider what we don’t believe in  known as confirmation bias  take us away from what is actually true. Believing foods to be good or bad without inserting overall context is to digress from what matters most. Eating any food should be an enjoyable process. But it should be done in a place where feelings of ‘good or bad’ are replaced with context  reality and ease. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

When a sports team scores a goal against our team  the other supporters celebrate whilst we despair. But the neutral supporter appreciates the goal for its non-emotional worth. Our beliefs in food should be no different. ⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣⁣
By process of elimination  within 0.89 seconds  most will instantly recognize this difference stems from caloric difference. Therefore  world recognised brands such as Coca Cola  McDonald’s and Starbucks do not offer nutritionally identical products  per product name across the world. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Though the insinuation that the USA is one of the most overweight nations in the world because they propose convenient  highly palatable foods and drinks that are higher in calories than other nations  this assumption falls by the wayside upon learning that most nations around the world offer the same American versions. After all  the companies above are all American.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
One reason some of the UK franchised versions are lower in calories is because  in April 2018  the government introduced the sugar tax  most notably on carbonated beverages/milkshakes. Inadvertently  as sugar makes up most of the caloric worth in these items  less sugar   fewer calories. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
It is worth noting that Hungary  France  Portugal and Mexico have a similar sanction on sugar. The latter having a flat rate. But the UK allows manufacturers to alter their formulas to reduce the amount of sugar - and many have done just that to lower the calorie value of their products. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Regarding the Big Mac   fries  the calorie reduction is more linear across fats and carbs. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

Though pseudoscience continues to claim that carbs make us fat  the evidence is beyond compelling that carbs do not inherently make humans fat when compared to protein or dietary fat. What does make humans fat is a consistent calorie surplus over time. See the last slide for a secondary analysis of a systematic review.⁣⁣

Inflammation is the new buzzword used by industry quacks looking to capitalize on vulnerable populations. But despite claiming that diary should be avoided because it’s ‘pro-inflammatory’  a systematic review  see last slide  shows diary to be anti-inflammatory  not to mention nutrient rich.⁣⁣

Sugar has been reported by many as being the sole cause of obesity   disease causing. But a systematic review  see last slide  shows that sugar doesn’t cause fat gain - an overall calorie surplus does. Sugar consumption has also reduced in recent years and obesity has increased. The same review concluded that sugar doesn’t cause cardio-metabolic disease. ⁣⁣

There is no evidence that colon cleanses improve the wellbeing of healthy individuals. A systematic review  last slide  found that instead of the procedure resulting in benefits  there were multiple case reports describing adverse effects.⁣⁣

5660,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Of all three macronutrients  protein is the one we often strive to consume more of.⁣
⁣
Thus  consuming protein from protein dense snacks can serve as an elementary intervention to boost daily protein intake conveniently. Wise to this  many brands have taken it upon themselves to market protein versions of already popular snacks  such as chocolate bars   bite size treats.⁣
⁣
But although the protein labelling on the wrapper may be appropriate within snickers HQ in that their ‘protein’ version contains 10g of protein compared to 4.6g in their original bar  this protein increase of 5.4g doesn’t mean much for populations requiring upward of 20g. It also comes at nearly 3x the cost of an original snickers bar. ⁣
⁣
If such products are enjoyed and financial means are available  such products must be consumed. But there exist alternative interventions that satisfy taste  offer significantly higher protein and require less financial outlay. ⁣
⁣
For example  one could enjoy a smaller version of the original chocolate bar they enjoy more whilst accompanying it with a cost effective  protein rich snack they enjoy  such as low fat Greek yogurt and berries .⁣
⁣
Upon realisation  spending  1.25 per day to consume 9g of extra protein from graze protein bites may appear unwise when compared to spending  0.39 on low fat cheese they enjoy  consuming double the protein   nearly half the calories in the process.⁣
⁣
Misleading protein marketing is compounded when calorie dense foods like peanut butter and bread offer the same amount of protein  7x less cost and fewer calories than a heavily marketed ‘protein’ chocolate bar. ⁣
⁣
Whilst there are some snacks that justify their protein marketing and convenience with offerings of 20-25g of protein per bar/shake  it is upon you to analyse the label to check exactly how protein dense/cost effective the snack is.⁣

Brands will continue to capitalise on the protein trend  despite not satisfying your protein needs. Make sure you are aware that alternative  enjoyable opportunities exist. They offer more protein  similar convenience and less cost. ⁣

Thus  their relevance to the caffeinated family is somewhat marginal. In fact  if one regularly goes out for a ‘coffee’  but consumes a Frappuccino  it could be said that they regularly frequent desserts instead.⁣⁣⁣⁣⁣

We can unanimously agree that consuming an abundance of nutrients is beneficial for overall health. But if we apply the above definition to an individual’s overall dietary intake whilst appreciating nutrient acquisition and energy balance  we can hopefully agree that there can also be allowance of nutrition-less foods as long as caloric adherence prevails. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Because whilst clean eating extremists lament those who choose to include nutritionally sparse foods in any quantity  if one already consumes sufficient nutrients via nutritious  minimally processed foods  those health related benefits are already attained. ⁣⁣⁣

Thus  if there exists an enjoyed food bereft of nutrients  but which still fits one’s energy needs  it must still be allowed. Protein and fibre rich foods are more likely to satiate  but we must appreciate that they can still contain the same  or more caloric density than some foods low in protein or fibre. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Of course  food behaviour is an important consideration in this discussion. If one finds themself satiated more by consuming protein   fibre rich foods  and non-nutritious foods lead to low satiety and excessive caloric intake  one must factor this into their eating decisions. ⁣⁣⁣

5664,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Nobody in the world  or certainly very few  intentionally aim to be overweight. Yet it has happened to more than 65  of us. Whilst gaining fat appears relatively straightforward  reducing fat continues to be problematic. As does our understanding of the process required to do so.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Google  social media  friends and family will all suggest means to achieve fat loss. The unanimous message from such sources is that one has to consume less food. And with this in mind  many attempt to severely reduce episodes of eating and minimise portion sizes.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
The problem with intuitive use of the above method is that alteration of body composition is not subjective. Instead  it answers objectively to the numeric balance of energy. Therefore  unmeasured reduction of meals or quantity of food in meals/snacks/drinks may be redundant to fat loss unless actual energy within meals/snacks/drinks is accounted for and executed in accordance with energy requirements.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
As the above example shows  reducing episodes of eating does not necessarily guarantee a calorie deficit. Here  an individual is hoping that their assumption of ‘eating less’ will support the goal. But the reality is that the individual is not factually aware of the caloric volume they consume. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Alternatively  accurate calculation of an individual’s compositional information in relation to TDEE can determine basic values of energy required to enter a state of caloric deficit. Thus  assumption is replaced by certain science whilst inclusion of all foods is possible.⁣⁣⁣⁣

The simplicity of accurately adhering to a consistent caloric deficit is your fat loss science.

5666,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Perception  noun  means  the way in which something is regarded  understood or interpreted. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If this meaning is applied to the context of food  many will have obtained pre-existing perceptions about the food they eat. Such as the caloric insignificance of enjoying a coffee based drink and a chocolate muffin with a friend  compared to a seemingly calamitous binge eating episode featuring 4 chocolate based snacks. Yet in this specific example  if erroneous perception prevails  the insignificant coffee and few impromptu nibbles of the muffin will result in consumption of nearly double the calories.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In a similar thought  the idea of consuming half packet of biscuits or two donuts will likely appear detrimental to compositional goals if repeated regularly - and with valid reason. Yet the proposition of drinking a coffee and 3 biscuits appears intrinsically more supportive to caloric control. Alas  in this example  it is not. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Any collection of food can fit any goal in isolation. What occurs over weeks  months and years will define compositional and functional outcomes. It must be said that these coffees are large portions with whole milk. Smaller portions with low fat milks will reduce caloric volume.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Of course  there are abundances of calorie sparse  nutritious  fibre rich foods which are more likely to physically nourish and satiate - these positive perceptions inadvertently mean such foods are less likely to be open to erroneous perceptions. ⁣⁣

5667,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"There is an obvious irony that common  inexpensive household items such as bread and milk contain as much  or more  protein than expensive products heavily centred around protein marketing. ⁣
⁣⁣
One’s desire for protein density is usually virtue of knowledge that diets relatively high in protein are advantageous across an array of health and fitness goals. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Fat loss can be supported by the elevated levels of satiety achieved from sufficient protein consumption. Muscle gain can occur though optimal protein synthesis. And general well-being/repairing of tissues/support of bodily functions can be optimized. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Wise to this  a multitude of brands have created ‘protein’ versions of existing products to appeal to those intent on consuming protein for goal related purposes. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If one is on a journey of nutritional optimisation  protein consumption will likely be relatively high. But as you can see  the word itself  presented in large font  does not necessarily make that product a justifiable choice.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Because upon evaluating actual protein content  alongside consideration of additional matters of importance such as cost and caloric value  buying items on the basis of a word can become pointless. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
For example  though one may be bedazzled by a cereal bar boasting protein content on it’s label  realising that its protein value is equivalent to  and nearly 10x the price  of a non marketed single slice of seeded bread may lead them to reconsider their purchase. ⁣⁣
Given that all choices incrementally accumulate towards overall protein intake  any marketed choice should be consumed if enjoyed. But rest assured  there exist non marketed items which contain equivalent  or more protein at a fraction of the cost.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Protein is essential. But it is fairly clear that items are being designed by brands who aim to cash in on a hugely beneficial macronutrient. It may be in your interest to consider the legitimate protein sources that don’t grab the exaggerated headlines.⁣⁣

5668,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Volume  noun  is ‘the amount of space that a substance or object occupies  or that is enclosed within a container.’⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If we repurpose this definition to define objects as food and containers as stomachs  then also include caloric volume into the conversation  we can see from my graphic that volume of calories consumed doesn’t necessarily equate to volume of food consumed.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
In fact  in my example of randomised food intake over time  one could consume 2821 calories from perceivably ‘not much’ and relatively few bites of snack based foods   condiments. But they could also consume just 972 calories and much more total food  including a meal  large portions of fruit  vegetables and lower calorie snacks. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
If the goal is to reduce body fat  one of the first interventions of use may be to create feeding environments whereby the individual is adhering to a caloric deficit  but feels satiated. Ensuring this occurs decreases likelihood of consuming excessive calories and relapsing on past behaviours that resulted in a caloric surplus over time.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Instead of embarking on an ultra restrictive diet that proposes inadequately small portions of food  a more sustainable approach may be to identify lower calorie foods you can enjoy in large quantities  and also identify those high calorie foods that perhaps require moderation.⁣⁣
⁣⁣
For example  18 large strawberries  300g  represents a relatively large volume of food in the form of 18  bites and 90 calories. 4 millionaire’s shortbread minis  80g  represents a relatively small volume of food in the form of 4 bites and 400 calories. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The above serves as an educative steer away from dietary dogma that insists you must eat small amounts of food to lose body fat. No food inherently makes you lose  maintain or gain fat  your management of its quantity does. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Thus  consuming more food volume  but less caloric volume may be the simple intervention you require to achieve your fat loss goal. ⁣⁣

For example  consuming 6 chocolate digestives in one day  which takes a combined total of 155 seconds   adds 498 calories to one’s daily intake. ⁣⁣Though this can be facilitated  it is a large chunk of most individual’s daily energy intake.⁣
⁣
Being aware of lower calorie choices which allow us to consume similar portion sizes means that we do not have to change habit as such  but instead strategically support our energy intake better.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣
As the graphic shows  each biscuit/cookie can be very different in baseline calorie values. Some have more calories  some have less. Some have more sugar  some have less. Some taste great  some taste okay. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Understand that whilst there are more nutritious snacking options which should also be explored  snacks of the ilk shown in my graphic can absolutely be a valid option if the overall diet is universally supported with it’s respective elements.⁣

5670,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"By definition  a carbohydrate is a biomolecule consisting of carbon  hydrogen and oxygen. It also happens to be an energy source. ⁣
⁣
But over the last few decades  carbohydrates have been met with revulsion and/or fear. Mainly by those who sympathize with the notion consumption of carbs will make them fat  or prevent them from losing fat.⁣
⁣⁣
The immediate problem with these claims is the mirky differentiation of carbohydrates as an entity within edible food. Pizza  pasta  chips  bread and pastry all fall inside the umbrella of “Don’t eat it because its got carbs and you’ll get fat”. But if we examine the exact ingredients in these foods we can see that carbohydrates are not the only macronutrient present. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The examples displayed on the right of this graphic represent foods containing calories from carbs  protein and more pertinently  fat - which houses over double the caloric density. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Fat contains 9 calories per gram  compared to 4 calories per gram within protein and carbs respectively. Therefore  the presence of protein and fat  via additional ingredients  within food will increase its overall caloric worth. Calorie balance  of any macronutrient ratio  determines body composition. Not carbs. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The futility of the ‘carbs make you fat’ argument is compelled by the fact that fruit and vegetables are mostly made up of carbohydrates. Therefore by persecuting carbs in such generic terms  one would be inadvertently claiming that ‘broccoli makes you fat’. ⁣This point is proven by the outcome of the ‘rice reduction diet’ experiment  swipe left . ⁣
⁣⁣
The body of evidence  see last slide as an example  shows that body fat has and always will be about the balance of energy  irrespective of carb consumption. Cutting out carbs may create a calorie deficit  but the same applies if fat and protein are removed and/or energy expenditure is increased. ⁣
⁣
For composition  if calories and protein are equated  the ratio of carbs and fats you consume doesn’t matter. Do what you prefer. ⁣

5671,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"When people claim “calories are not created equal”  what they hopefully mean is that macronutrients are metabolized differently. Because a calorie will always be equal in that it is a unit of energy  regardless of the source.⁣
⁣
Charlatans who tweet that ‘macronutrients are dumb’ and that energy balance is ‘outdated’ use these persuasive nouns to deflate the significance of energy balance. This is to manipulate uneducated people into believing their invented falsehoods and gibberish dieting methods. ⁣
⁣
Gravity  invented in 1687  is one of the most groundbreaking discoveries within humankind. It’s efficacy remains robust despite its discovery centuries ago. Energy balance will follow suit. ⁣
⁣
Just because absorbing different macronutrients results in varying caloric availability  it does not mean you need to throw out the entire principle. Doing so would be like saying gravity doesn’t exist because airplanes fly.⁣
⁣
As you can see  protein has a notably higher thermic effect than carbs and fats  resulting in greater energy expenditure and fewer overall ‘net’ calories consumed. But in spite of this  calories in vs out is still entirely applicable to the outcome. There is simply a greater energy expenditure during the process which elevates TDEE. ⁣
⁣
Over time  energy balance can change when calories are equated  but this is because of different macros within those calories. It is why high protein diets result in greater energy expenditure  maintenance of muscle and satiety. All of which affect the balance of energy. This is why measuring protein may be useful.⁣
⁣
But given that most foods contain multiple macros  measuring total calories consumed is still a very accurate method to understand to total energy intake.⁣
⁣
Various things  such as hormones  play a role in changing energy balance. But they don’t define it. Calories will always be units of equal energy - the balance of which defines composition. ⁣

5676,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"For those intending to reduce overall caloric intake in order to reduce fat  these calorie saving meat swaps may provide you with several easy opportunities. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
One immediate observation with these meat sources is that most of the lower calorie alternatives are higher in protein. For example  200g chicken drumstick gets 144 of its calories from protein and the remaining 316 from fat. Whereas the skinless chicken breast gets 192 of its calories from protein and the remaining 18 from fat. Thus  the breast has significantly higher protein density per calorie. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
As there are no carbohydrates present in fresh meat - the calories will always derive from protein or fat. If the calorie value is high  but the protein value is low  it means the meat is high in fat. Fat is not to be feared  but it contains 9 calories per gram  over double the caloric density of protein and carbs. Thus  foods high in fat are relatively high in calories. ⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
All meats can of course be enjoyed as part of a balanced diet. But if consumed regularly whilst pursuing a calorie deficit for fat loss  you may want to consider more items on the right hand side. After all  you’ll still be experiencing the same volume of food  very similar tastes  but significantly fewer calories which supports a calorie deficit.⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Small  effortless changes accumulate over time to produce a bigger result. Why  Because they were so easy to maintain that you kept doing them.⁣
⁣
Making the above 9 swaps across 9 varied meals would enable you to save 1491 calories  enjoy the same volume  taste   increase protein intake. Across 90 meals  you’d save nearly 15 000 calories... And so on. ⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
These swaps offer a practical   enjoyable opportunity for you to significantly alter your calorie intake to support your goal without the overwhelming hassle of planned dietary upheaval or extreme restriction of foods you enjoy. ⁣⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣
Most fast food is convenient and hyper palatable. These are the cornerstones of your decision to pursue them. Most of this food is inherently calorie dense. Therefore  if  you regularly consume high amounts  the possibility of being overweight increases. Most whole food is not as convenient  hyper palatable or calorie dense. And the literature shows that most successful controlled diets are based on whole foods. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
However  be sure to know that being overweight is not because of calorie dense fast food  but one’s management of it. Overall dietary intake  including portion selection and energy expenditure will dictate one’s inherent compositional outcomes. Not ‘a McDonald’s’.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
If you enjoy fast food  you must eat it. This post illuminates how selection of different options can result in significantly different energy intakes over time. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
When you select large portion sizes you may want to ask yourself if this is truly required. If the answer is yes  then so be it. But if the answer no  you can select lower calorie equivalents and still enjoy the same palatable experiences.⁣
⁣⁣⁣
‘A Burger King’ or ‘a KFC’ may temporarily compromise your desired nutritional goal  but depending on your overall diet over time  it may not. Thus  Burger King  KFC  or any fast food  need not automatically be labelled as a disaster by name alone. ⁣⁣⁣

The same caloric volumes of nuts and seeds will provide a host of nutrients and potential satiety that chocolate does not. If they are enjoyed  they should also be consumed. But doing so should be the result of preference and being informed  not through assumption. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Fruit also contains an abundance of micronutrients and is generally very low in calories. But it is not chocolate. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
My primary graphic shows just 10 caloric comparisons between 20 chocolate based foods. During research  I found that the most popular bars offered between 200-250 calories.⁣
⁣⁣
If chocolate is enjoyed  it must be eaten. Though we are often instructed to eradicate it from our diet if our compositional goals are to be achieved  such advice lacks context or logic. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
For example  the context of one’s overall diet is key to the success of compositional change or maintenance  not individual foods. Management of all foods over time define the outcome. Therefore  a supportive  calorie controlled diet  rich in micronutrients  protein and fibre can absolutely be supplemented with moderate intake of chocolate bars. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
The 10 eating experiences propositioned in this graphic will occur over a relatively short time  yet there is a saving of over 1000 calories whilst still eating foods you enjoy. Over weeks  months and years  recognising the existence of such opportunities allows you to eat more of what you love and sustain enjoyment when striving towards your goal. ⁣⁣
⁣⁣
Contrary to what the diet industry perpetuates  losing fat is simply recognizing how you can align enjoyment and science to make the method sustainable whilst fewer calories are consumed. The changes required are most likely minimal. ⁣⁣

5688,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"⁣According to the Oxford dictionary  snack  noun   is a small amount of food eaten between meals.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Whilst Oxford dictionary definitions are not entirely relevant to one’s nutritional understanding  the use of ‘small’ may hold relevance. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
For example  for a fat loss seeking  lightly active 190cm male  weighing 95kg with a 15  deficit target of 2200 calories per day  some portions of the snacks on the left can equate to a quarter of his required daily intake before additional snacks and main meals. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
For a fat loss seeking  lightly active 165cm female  weighing 80kg with a 15  deficit target of 1700 calories per day  some portions of the snacks on the left equate to a third of her required daily intake before additional snacks and main meals. In both examples  such portion sizes may hinder adherence to a calorie deficit. What’s more  are they necessary  ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
The salient variable in both these examples may well be one’s recognition of a calorie deficit target. This being a means to measure and align behaviour  consuming calories  with the fat loss principle  a calorie deficit . It could be argued that if there was awareness of the required deficit target  along with caloric volume consumed  that one would be more likely to manage portion sizes accordingly. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Perhaps main meals would be structured in a way in which large caloric volume of snacks was no longer necessary or caloric volume of main meals reduced. Perhaps there may be realization that satiety could still be achieved with smaller portions of the same enjoyed foods. Or that previously deemed ‘insignificant’ and thus  excessively portioned snacks was exactly where deficit adherence collapsed. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Contrary to the dogmatic new social media trends  being in control of your energy intake to nurture your compositional goals is not obsessive. It is simply the most enlightening way to educate yourself on the relationship between your food behaviours and the scientific principle behind the success of your goal. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

5689,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Juice diet salespeople promise fat loss and cleansing of your anatomy. But sometimes promises don’t mirror the reality.
-

Juicing may produce results deemed acceptable to one’s nutritional journey  but profoundly more logical interventions exist.
-

You do not need to stop eating solid food and immerse yourself in puréed pomegranate   kale to lose fat. You just need to reduce total calories consumed and/or increase energy expenditure to create a calorie deficit.
-

When juicing  much of the weight you lose is muscle due to low calorie extremity and lack of protein.
-

They also don’t tell you that the organs you already have already detoxify. Juice will not do anything that your organs don’t already do.
-

Prohibiting consumption of food in a bid to lose fat is disordered. Food is not the inherent cause of dietary problems - management of it is. In fact  food is required to remain alive and support overall health. 
-

Denying yourself of food on an ultra aggressive  low calorie juice diet will result in hunger  misery   poor function. To add  many juicers strip the fibre from fruit   vegetables  lowering the chance of satiety after consumption. 
-

The totalitarian consumption of juice will likely result in relentless frequenting of bathroom facilities where one must unbuckle and hang on for dear life. 
-

The aftermath of a juice diet is usually weight gain because nothing meaningful has been learned regarding adherence to a sustainable  enjoyable way to lose fat. Instead  dietary habits that created the problem return.
-

Lastly  you likely have more exciting things to do with your life  even during lockdown  that clean a juicer 3 times per day - an appliance purchased for  349.99 from a man with a wide grin as he snatched your hard earned money. I rest my case...

⁣⁣⁣⁣
Our situation here is one’s desire for body fat reduction  how calories consumed relate to it  and enjoyment obtained from eating food. These decisions and subsequent actions will likely result in adherence or non adherence the goal  in this example  a caloric deficit for fat loss  over time. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Since losing fat requires reduction in caloric volume  quantities of consumed calories are paramount to the outcome. Thus  obtaining caloric quantities of the food we’d like to eat informs us of its relation to our goal. This simple practice can be used when building meals. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
In the case of this chicken   chorizo pizza  basic and highly accessible information tells us that switching an extra large wrap for a large wrap can reduce calories by 45. And that 15g of chopped chorizo may be likely to suffice our tastebuds and our goal instead of an unregulated  seemingly similar handful  saving us 109 calories.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Swapping 125g handfuls of regular cheese for 50g of reduced fat cheese will allow us to eat a palatable volume  but for a significant 312 fewer calories.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Gaining the appreciation that green pepper and tomato purée are relatively low in calories will allow us to forego measuring their caloric volume at all. And that increasing low calorie protein sources such as chicken may increase the calories from that particular ingredient  but that the caloric increase is small enough to warrant it because of the additional satiety achieved. It also offsets the volume lost from the cheese reduction.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
In this comparison of the same pizza  the overall volume of the food is similar  but one is half the calories. The food you make may well be tasty in its original state  but be sure to know that small adjustments may be all that’s required for your favourite foods to remain just as tasty. Thus  it is a simple way to enjoy achieving your goal over time. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

⁣⁣⁣⁣
Protein  after all  is a noteworthy macronutrient in that it repairs tissues  helps build muscle  satiates  burns more calories during digestion than fats and carbs  making it universally important for any fitness or wellbeing goal. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
Most food on earth contains protein. Some are dense and some are sparse. But its mere presence in any dose is enough encouragement for organisations to plaster it all over their packaging. And the motive is probably more devious than simply alerting the consumer that protein is present. It serves as a cornerstone to the sale of that product. And for an elevated price.⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
As one can gather from this list of similar foods  a product that boasts of its protein content may not necessarily contain more protein per weight than a product bereft of marketing  but similar or greater in protein content. ⁣⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣⁣
As ever  the onus is on us  the consumer  to source the nutritional information of any given food before we buy it. This information is usually on the back in font size 3.5. ⁣Once one reflects upon this  the use of ‘protein’  in font 7256  becomes irrelevant. It becomes merely a word. ⁣⁣⁣⁣

5692,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"When it comes to losing fat  there exist many extreme  short term solutions. But most are too unrealistic to continue long term and don’t allow enough time for people to build sustainable habits. Habits are the currency that define many of our actions and behaviours.⁣
⁣
When  gymshark asked me to join their campaign  which is centred around building long term habits for positive change   I realised instantly that it resonated with my core message. I am forever challenging my audience to forego the temptations of short term fixes  instead advocating how long term approaches have a higher chance of achieving meaningful change. ⁣
⁣
You can look at this in 2 ways. First  that some snacks are calorie dense  and by cutting them out completely you are eliminating food sources that might make a calorie deficit more difficult. The problem with this is that those foods give you pleasure. Removing them will take that away from you. No food inherently makes you gain fat  only the amount of it does. Think of this intervention as a poorly constructed high rise building that falls down during a storm.⁣
⁣
The alternative view is that you know some snacks are calorie dense  but you also know that eliminating them will eliminate pleasure  which is to the detriment of your mental health. Instead  making educated adjustments  intelligent swaps and controlling portions of calorie dense  enjoyed foods can give you the ability to carry on eating them whilst simultaneously supporting your fat loss goal. This view is like a tree. It requires several roots to gradually build a structure that  over time  cannot fall down.⁣
⁣
Sometimes you need to go slow to go fast. When you do this  you realise that losing fat long term is not about taking drastic action and motivating yourself to climb the eternal mountain of struggle portrayed by many. Achieving the body you want long term will likely be the result of your ability to accommodate a calorie deficit with as many of your existing preferences as possible over time. ⁣
⁣
Patience and education make you powerful. With them  you cannot fall down.⁣

5694,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"This assortment of slides is not an endorsement of fast food as much as it is not a shaming of it as a food choice. Instead  it is simply a selection of food from some of the world’s favourite fast food chains. This post is therefore an objective arrangement of basic nutritional information. Swipe left to see more lists.⁣
⁣⁣⁣
The establishments included in this post have existed for decades. This is undoubtedly because it is abundantly clear that millions continue to enjoy consumption of such food. And whilst most items within these lists are not particularly nutrient dense  they are still legitimate items of food which should be eaten if enjoyed. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Instead of basing opinion on subjective metaphors and closed minded assumptions that fast food will send us to hospital  it is more useful to consider a more logical approach. Correlation of consumption in relation to regularity and overall dietary intake is a more worthwhile way to gauge the effect of fast food on one’s overall health. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
The early 2000s brought about mass hysteria regarding fast food and it’s negative effect on health. But most references were anecdotal  open to infinite nuance and disregarded a plethora of relevant variables under preconditioned bias. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
One example can be found in the ‘Supersize Me’ experiment/documentary in 2004. It professed the negative impact McDonald’s had on the subject’s health. But the subject consumed nothing but McDonald’s food for one whole month. Whilst the findings may have been accurate  they are rendered as entirely useless to those who do not consume 90  McDonald’s meals per month. Thus  we can estimate that the findings from supersize me are irrelevant.⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
For optimal health  excessive consumption of fast food is not going to be particularly beneficial. But if consumption is moderate and accompanied by an overall supportive dietary process rich in nutrients  it can have an enjoyed position in one’s life now and again. ⁣⁣⁣

5695,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Despite the many accumulative causes of fat gain  sugar is branded by many foolish nutrition fanatics as the sole perpetrator. ‘Qualified’ practitioners continue to deliver claims that eating sugar will result in more fat storage  regardless of any other variables. This simply isn’t true.⁣
⁣⁣
Sugar is a carbohydrate. It contains 4 calories per gram  does not contain any nutrients  fibre or satiating qualities. Whilst lack of satiety may subjectively lead to excessive consumption of more calories  the same presumption can be argued for any food source.⁣
⁣
Many foods high in sugar happen to be high in calories. But the latter defines body fat  not the former. Correlation does not equal causation.⁣
⁣⁣
100g of sugar amounts to 400 calories. But 100g of sugar within this selection of consumable food amounts to 3022 calories. This directly shows us that there are 2622 non-sugar comprising calories within these foods that are still relevant to the balance of energy that defines composition.⁣
⁣⁣
As evidence continues to show  a calorie surplus  by whatever means  causes an increase in body fat. Sugar may be part of this surplus  but so are complex carbs  fat and protein. According to various meta analysis  when calories are equated  fructose containing sugars do not appear to cause fat gain compared to other forms of macronutrients.⁣
⁣
Whilst foods containing balanced macros may offer more satiety  some of these foods still include sugar. And whilst foods disproportionately high in sugar and calories are less likely to satiate  this does not prove that sugar makes people fat. This simply shows that less satiating foods may result in over consumption  and that over consumption is more likely to cause a calorie surplus. Therefore issue must be directed at food behaviors  balanced intake  food variety and understanding of energy balance. Not just sugar.⁣
⁣⁣
Sugar can contribute to fat gain. But only alongside other deep rooted nutritional  behavioral and psychological variables that produce a consistent caloric surplus. Sugar is yet another scapegoat that continues to be unproven by science.⁣

5696,thefitnesschef_,influencers,"Intuitive eating has become fairly popular in recent years. Scores of bloggers and popular literature promote a concept that disregards physiological processes such as energy balance in favour of following one’s dietary intuition. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣
As a concept that free’s mindsets of those who don’t wish to alter composition  it cannot be faulted. In fact  it must be applauded. But when it’s promoted as a superior method to those who do want to alter composition  it has faults.⁣
⁣⁣⁣
For compositional change  the essence of the concept appears sound in that waiting for hunger/satiety cue’s before/during eating is helpful. But the first major issue arrives as soon as the hunger is dealt with. Whilst hunger is being intuitively ‘nurtured’  the extent of energy consumed is largely unaccounted for. ⁣⁣⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Therefore  whilst satisfying hunger is achieved  the effect on one’s composition is unknown. And whilst calorie counting is not the only way to lose fat  it is of most relevance to the principles of calorie balance - the defining factor for composition. ⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Of course one can lose fat whilst following IE structures. But in doing so  fat loss becomes much harder to predict when enjoyment of calorie dense food is unaccounted for. By listening to our desire  it is highly likely that we will consume such foods in excessive quantities.⁣
⁣
So when fitness bloggers preach that their 14  body fat arrived intuitively  there is no doubt that there was prior education regarding calorie values and portion size.⁣
⁣⁣⁣
Each individual is free to choose which dieting method works for them. Calorie awareness is the simplest measurement of adherence. It should eventually morph into skilled eyeballing of portion sizes in alignment with a more intuitive approach anyway. Unlike many portray it  you do not need to count calories forever. ⁣
⁣⁣⁣
But when beginning a fat loss goal  learning the information most relevant to your goal is going to be exceptionally useful. That way  you can leave confusion behind  gain important knowledge for a period of time and refer to it in a relaxed manner for the rest of your life. ⁣⁣⁣

Which is completely understandable seeing as it’s been a year since being in lockdown. But I’ve been speaking to a few people today about helping them find their ‘Why’. Your ‘why’ is what motivates and pushes you towards succeeding. Without a ‘why’ you are just doing it without any real reason  direction or goal and will quickly become demotivated or sidetracked. Find your ‘Why’ and your attitude and motivation will change.
My ‘why’ is because I owe my future self the best possible life. I’ve been working all throughout lockdown  and keeping as fit as I possibly can because I know that what I do now will effect my life in five years. Actions and choice that I make right now will effect my life either positively or negatively  and not only mine but my current family   future family. Find your ‘Why’

The first post is me back in 2018 being interviewed about mental health  online trolling and the effects that social media has on young people. I was new to the celebrity life and was talking from personal experiences and what I had seen happen to others  but very much at the start of my journey in educating myself. The second slide is more recent  and something that I will always be proud of doing. After taking time to educate myself  I was fortunate enough to be able to share my own personal experiences and advice with this incredible group that was viewed watched and related to by millions of people while appearing on the BBC documentary Mimi on a Mission. It’s a small stepping stone from building my own awareness to becoming active in this space  but this was an important moment for me as I was able to educate and comfort the younger generation and whilst learning from them too.

So many people go through challenges in life and are able to bounce back  even when the odds are against you. Tiger Woods is a prime example. From building up to being the best golfer on the planet  to having everything come crashing down. As he has proven to people all over the world  having the ’Tiger mentality’ of determination and resilience can really change your life for the better. A brand new documentary on the rise and fall of Tiger Wood’s is out now on Sky Documentaries with both episodes being available on  SkyTV. It provides a detailed look at the life of a global icon  seeing that he too is just human. I recommend any sporting athlete  young adult or anyone who feels like they don’t see any positivity coming their way  to watch the documentary  I’ll definitely be watching this weekend.

I was never sure how much of a recovery I would make but I was so focused on showing my story and using myself and circumstances to help others either learn more or find some sort of comfort that they’re not the only ones going through it  that it helped me stay focused on recovery.

I spoke about personal highs and lows and how it is to be in a world where most people need validation on social media to feel positive about themselves.
Honestly one of the most eye opening things I’ve done and I urge everyone  especially young people and teenagers who look up to influencers to watch all FIVE Mimi on a Mission episodes. Exclusively available on BBC iPlayer on Saturday 26th September.
